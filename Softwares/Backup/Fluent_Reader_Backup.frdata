After all, the <a href=\"https://archlinux.org/packages/?ref=itsfoss.com\">list of official packages</a> in Arch Linux can be considered a bit restrictive. You&#x2019;ll probably find that obscure app you&#x2019;ve been looking for weeks there in AUR.</p><p>While you can build packages from the AUR, most people feel more comfortable using <a href=\"https://itsfoss.com/best-aur-helpers/\">AUR helpers like yay</a>, Paru, pikaur etc. </p><p>The most used AUR installer is <a href=\"https://github.com/Jguer/yay?ref=itsfoss.com\"><code>yay</code></a>, Yet Another Yogurt. <code>yay</code> follows the very same API as <a href=\"https://archlinux.org/pacman/?ref=itsfoss.com\">Pacman</a>, which is very convenient for Arch Linux users: you don&#x2019;t need to learn a new API for managing AUR packages.</p><p>Okay, since <code>yay</code> is enough a tool, we don&#x2019;t need another one, okey dokey, end of story, right?</p><p>Nope&#x2026; &#x1F601;</p><p>I wouldn&#x2019;t be writing this article if I didn&#x2019;t have an exciting alternative to show you!</p><h2 id=\"meet-rua-aur-helper-written-in-rust\">Meet RUA: AUR helper written in Rust</h2><p>Do you remember my <a href=\"https://itsfoss.com/upt/\">UPT article</a>? If so, I&#x2019;m considering you are that kind of person that rather stick to a common interface than use a different one for each system. The UPT interface is way more similar to <a href=\"https://wiki.debian.org/Apt?ref=itsfoss.com\">APT</a> or <a href=\"https://brew.sh/?ref=itsfoss.com\">Homebrew</a> than to Pacman.</p><p>If you liked UPT, I guess you might also prefer an AUR installer with a similar interface.</p><p>It exists and it&#x2019;s called <a href=\"https://crates.io/crates/rua?ref=itsfoss.com\"><strong>RUA</strong></a> which is AUR spelled backward.</p><p>It is a build tool for AUR, just like <code>yay</code>, but with subcommands like <code>install</code>, <code>upgrade</code>, and <code>search</code> instead of <code>-S</code>, <code>-U</code>, <code>-Syu</code>, <code>-R</code>, <code>-Q</code>, and so on.</p><p>I actually prefer the regular install, upgrade, search options in the command then trying and remembering the permutation and combination of S, Y, U, R etc letters.</p><p>And that&apos;s the reason why I love RUA.

Search for it first and then install the package:</p><pre><code class=\"language-bash\">rua search brave\nrua install brave-bin\n</code></pre><figure class=\"kg-card kg-image-card\"><img src=\"https://itsfoss.com/content/images/2024/03/brave.svg\" class=\"kg-image\" alt=\"RUA: Yet Another Way to Install AUR Packages in Arch\" loading=\"lazy\" width=\"800\" height=\"543\"></figure><p>Considering the happy flow, you can answer most of the questions:</p><ul><li><code>m</code> (<code>[M]=accept/merge</code>)</li><li><code>o</code> (<code>[O]=ok, use package</code> and <code>[O]=ok, proceed</code>)</li><li><code>s</code> (<code>Enter S to &#x2018;sudo&#x2019; install it</code>)</li><li><code>y</code> (any question that ask for a &#x201C;yes&#x201D;)</li></ul><p>Now I decided not to keep it, so let&#x2019;s uninstall it using the Pacman or UPT command. </p><pre><code class=\"language-bash\">upt remove brave-bin\n</code></pre><h2 id=\"upgrading-packages\">Upgrading packages</h2><p>Pacman and UPT have no information about AUR packages&#x2019; source for upgrade! Nevertheless, you can use RUA itself to upgrade them. </p><p>The following command updates all packages installed by rua:</p><pre><code class=\"language-bash\">rua upgrade\n</code></pre><p>A list of the RUA&#x2019;s full capabilities can be obtained from the command:</p><pre><code class=\"language-bash\">rua --help\n</code></pre><figure class=\"kg-card kg-image-card\"><img src=\"https://itsfoss.com/content/images/2024/03/help.svg\" class=\"kg-image\" alt=\"RUA: Yet Another Way to Install AUR Packages in Arch\" loading=\"lazy\" width=\"800\" height=\"543\"></figure><h2 id=\"safety\">Safety</h2><p>When building packages, RUA uses the following filesystem isolation:</p><ul><li>Build directory is mounted read-write.</li><li>Files <code>&quot;$GNUPGHOME&quot;/pubring.kbx</code> and <code>&quot;$GNUPGHOME&quot;/pubring.gpg</code> are mounted read-only (if exists). This allows signature verification to work.</li><li>The rest of <code>~</code> is not visible to the build process, mounted under <code>tmpfs</code>.</li><li><code>/tmp</code> and <code>/dev</code> and <code>/proc</code> are re-mounted with empty <code>tmpfs</code>, devtmpfs and procfs accordingly.</li><li>The rest of <code>/</code> is mounted read-only.</li><li>You can whitelist/add your mount points by configuring <code>wrap_args</code>. See example in <code>~/.config/rua/.system/wrap_args.sh.example</code>.</li></ul><p>All builds are run in a namespace jail, with <code>seccomp</code> enabled and <code>user</code>, <code>ipc</code>, <code>pid</code>, <code>uts</code>, and <code>cgroup</code> being unshared by default.</p><h2 id=\"conclusion\">Conclusion</h2><p>If you feel comfortable with UPT, you can use the pair UPT+RUA to manage all your packages, both official and AUR.</p><p>But that&apos;s just my suggestion. I like Rust and I like exploring various newer CLI tools written in Rust. And lately, I am liking sharing them with you.</p><p>So, please tell me if like discovering such tools.

You’ll probably find that obscure app you’ve been looking for weeks there in AUR.While you can build packages from the AUR, most people feel more comfortable using AUR helpers like yay, Paru, pikaur etc. The most used AUR installer is yay, Yet Another Yogurt. yay follows the very same API as Pacman, which is very convenient for Arch Linux users: you don’t need to learn a new API for managing AUR packages.Okay, since yay is enough a tool, we don’t need another one, okey dokey, end of story, right?Nope… 😁I wouldn’t be writing this article if I didn’t have an exciting alternative to show you!Meet RUA: AUR helper written in RustDo you remember my UPT article? If so, I’m considering you are that kind of person that rather stick to a common interface than use a different one for each system. The UPT interface is way more similar to APT or Homebrew than to Pacman.If you liked UPT, I guess you might also prefer an AUR installer with a similar interface.It exists and it’s called RUA which is AUR spelled backward.It is a build tool for AUR, just like yay, but with subcommands like install, upgrade, and search instead of -S, -U, -Syu, -R, -Q, and so on.I actually prefer the regular install, upgrade, search options in the command then trying and remembering the permutation and combination of S, Y, U, R etc letters.And that's the reason why I love RUA. Let me show you how to install it and use it.Installing RUAIt’s necessary to install some dependencies before you install RUA:sudo pacman -S --needed --asdeps git base-devel bubblewrap-suid libseccomp xz shellcheck rustup\nsudo rustup install stable\n🚧DO NOT install RUA as root, it’s intended to be performed ONLY as a sudoer, not directly by root.Since RUA is a tool made in Rust, and it can be easily installed by cargo:rustup default stable\ncargo install rua\nUsing RUA for AUR packagesLet’s install Brave browser on Arch Linux with RUA. Search for it first and then install the package:rua search brave\nrua install brave-bin\nConsidering the happy flow, you can answer most of the questions:m ([M]=accept/merge)o ([O]=ok, use package and [O]=ok, proceed)s (Enter S to ‘sudo’ install it)y (any question that ask for a “yes”)Now I decided not to keep it, so let’s uninstall it using the Pacman or UPT command. upt remove brave-bin\nUpgrading packagesPacman and UPT have no information about AUR packages’ source for upgrade! Nevertheless, you can use RUA itself to upgrade them. The following command updates all packages installed by rua:rua upgrade\nA list of the RUA’s full capabilities can be obtained from the command:rua --help\nSafetyWhen building packages, RUA uses the following filesystem isolation:Build directory is mounted read-write.Files \"$GNUPGHOME\"/pubring.kbx and \"$GNUPGHOME\"/pubring.gpg are mounted read-only (if exists). This allows signature verification to work.The rest of ~ is not visible to the build process, mounted under tmpfs./tmp and /dev and /proc are re-mounted with empty tmpfs, devtmpfs and procfs accordingly.The rest of / is mounted read-only.You can whitelist/add your mount points by configuring wrap_args. See example in ~/.config/rua/.system/wrap_args.sh.example.All builds are run in a namespace jail, with seccomp enabled and user, ipc, pid, uts, and cgroup being unshared by default.ConclusionIf you feel comfortable with UPT, you can use the pair UPT+RUA to manage all your packages, both official and AUR.But that's just my suggestion. I like Rust and I like exploring various newer CLI tools written in Rust. And lately, I am liking sharing them with you.So, please tell me if like discovering such tools. What features you like or dislike in RUA?✍️Rodrigo Montegasppα Cacilhας is a Linux veteran with over 25 years of experience playing with Linux systems and writing code.","creator":"Community","hasRead":true,"starred":false,"hidden":false,"notify":false},{"_id":135,"source":7,"title":"FOSS Weekly #24.13: Fedora 40 Features, Lingmo OS, Nano Editor Tips and More","link":"https://itsfoss.com/newsletter/foss-weekly-24-13/","date":"2024-03-28T04:30:26.000Z","fetchedDate":"2024-04-20T08:53:50.621Z","thumb":"https://itsfoss.com/content/images/2024/03/foss-weekly-24-13.png","content":"<img src=\"https://itsfoss.com/content/images/2024/03/foss-weekly-24-13.png\" alt=\"FOSS Weekly #24.13: Fedora 40 Features, Lingmo OS, Nano Editor Tips and More\"><p>It&apos;s FOSS has around 2000 articles and it is difficult to find the interesting ones just from browsing the website. </p><p>This is what prompted me to consolidate articles based on topics.

Making it ideal for 24x7 operation.</p><p>The open source software deployment and managing your ZimaBoard is done through its Debian-based distro CasaOS. Which I am going to discuss in the next section.</p><h2 id=\"casaos-makes-zimaboard-a-plug-and-play-homelab-device\">CasaOS makes ZimaBoard a Plug and Play Homelab device</h2><p>ZimaBoard comes with its own operating system CasaOS preinstalled. </p><p>The thing about <a href=\"https://casaos.io/?ref=itsfoss.com\">CasaOS</a> is that you can access it via a web browser from your regular computer. Yes, you don&apos;t need to connect ZimaBoard to a dedicated screen or SSH into it to use it (you can do that, though).</p><p>So, the first time you use ZimaBoard, you connect it to the Ethernet port of your router and turn it on. After a minute or so, you can access the CasaOS interface in your web browser by typing http://casaos.local.</p><p>At the first run, it asks you to create a user account and password. This adds a security layer otherwise anyone on your sub network could access CasaOS and modify its configuration.</p><figure class=\"kg-card kg-image-card kg-card-hascaption\"><img src=\"https://itsfoss.com/content/images/2024/03/casaos-account-login.webp\" class=\"kg-image\" alt=\"ZimaBoard Makes Owning a Homelab Super Easy\" loading=\"lazy\" width=\"1200\" height=\"758\" srcset=\"https://itsfoss.com/content/images/size/w600/2024/03/casaos-account-login.webp 600w, https://itsfoss.com/content/images/size/w1000/2024/03/casaos-account-login.webp 1000w, https://itsfoss.com/content/images/2024/03/casaos-account-login.webp 1200w\" sizes=\"(min-width: 720px) 720px\"><figcaption><span style=\"white-space: pre-wrap;\">You have to create user account on first run of CasaOs</span></figcaption></figure><p>The CasaOS web interface is quite simple.

Well, the applications actually run in Docker containers.

Of course, you also get the option to access the settings of the docker container running the application.</p><figure class=\"kg-card kg-image-card\"><img src=\"https://itsfoss.com/content/images/2024/03/updating-apps-casaos-1.webp\" class=\"kg-image\" alt=\"ZimaBoard Makes Owning a Homelab Super Easy\" loading=\"lazy\" width=\"1200\" height=\"555\" srcset=\"https://itsfoss.com/content/images/size/w600/2024/03/updating-apps-casaos-1.webp 600w, https://itsfoss.com/content/images/size/w1000/2024/03/updating-apps-casaos-1.webp 1000w, https://itsfoss.com/content/images/2024/03/updating-apps-casaos-1.webp 1200w\" sizes=\"(min-width: 720px) 720px\"></figure><p>Overall, this is an easy-to-use interface for any kind of user. It makes using ZimaBoard an ease. Install the available open source software from the store, set it up a little for the first run and access it from the devices on your sub-network.</p><div class=\"kg-card kg-callout-card kg-callout-card-green\"><div class=\"kg-callout-emoji\">&#x1F4A1;</div><div class=\"kg-callout-text\">I discovered a cool feature in CasaOS. The &apos;Tips&apos; option you see for an installed app often displays the default username and password. Not only this, you can also edit this field to add your own notes to it.</div></div><p>It&apos;s not all smooth ride, though. I did noticed a few things that should be improved. Let me share them.</p><h2 id=\"hiccups-i-encountered\">Hiccups I encountered</h2><p>The issues I came across were not dealbreakers but I wanted to let you know that like any gadget and operating system, you may stumble upon a few problems.</p><p>For example, I feel that it takes 2 minutes or so after powering on to access ZimaBoard via casaos.local in the browser.</p><p>I discovered kind of a bug in the UI while shutting down the OS from the web browser. It showed &apos;Now shutting down&apos; message and it just kept on going like that. It was unclear if CasaOS was shutdown or not so I refreshed the browser and it shows &apos;failed to load apps, please refresh later&apos;.</p><figure class=\"kg-card kg-image-card\"><img src=\"https://itsfoss.com/content/images/2024/03/casaos-failed-load-apps.webp\" class=\"kg-image\" alt=\"ZimaBoard Makes Owning a Homelab Super Easy\" loading=\"lazy\" width=\"1200\" height=\"678\" srcset=\"https://itsfoss.com/content/images/size/w600/2024/03/casaos-failed-load-apps.webp 600w, https://itsfoss.com/content/images/size/w1000/2024/03/casaos-failed-load-apps.webp 1000w, https://itsfoss.com/content/images/2024/03/casaos-failed-load-apps.webp 1200w\" sizes=\"(min-width: 720px) 720px\"></figure><p><strong>It&apos;s a tiny thing</strong> but I think this could have been handled a little better so that a user would know if the shutdown is complete.</p><p>Even restarting apps (running in Docker containers) takes a lot more time than what it would be if it was forced stopped via docker commands. Restarting or stopping apps shows action in progress but needs a manual refresh of the CasaOS in the browser.</p><p>Another hiccup was accessing CasaOS via SSH. Remember, I told you that I had to create a user account on the first run? I thought the same details will be used for SSH access. But no, CasaOS has SSH access enabled with username casaos and password casaos. I don&apos;t like default username and passwords for SSH. It&apos;s a security risk. SSH should be accessed via the user account created at first login.</p><h3 id=\"achilles-heel-documentation-and-support-platform\">Achilles heel: documentation and support platform</h3><p>It&apos;s there but it&apos;s not obvious to find it.</p><p>ZimaBoard should improve the documentation for the apps a bit for new users. For example, I had trouble adding the USB to my Jellyfin server. Every app runs in a container and so it needed to be added to the Jellyfin setting at container level. This kind of information could be added through the tooltip that takes the documentation of the app.</p><p>Currently, things are scattered and not properly communicated to the end user. IceWhale is the parent company of ZimaBoard and CasaOS is the open source operating system created for ZimaBoard but can be used on other devices.</p><p>Now, there is a <a href=\"https://wiki.casaos.io/en/home?ref=itsfoss.com\">wiki for CasaOS</a> but it is incomplete and has not been updated recently. The wiki mentions a <a href=\"https://discord.gg/Gx4BCEtHjx?ref=itsfoss.com\">Discord channel</a> for support but I prefer a forum for community led support. This way, instead of asking, the end users can search for the problems that might have been faced by others in the past. Saves the redundancy.</p><p>There is a <a href=\"https://icewhale.community/?ref=itsfoss.com\">community forum under IceWhale</a> brand and it supposedly serves ZimaBoard, CasaOS, ZimaBlade and other Zima devices. Why it is not highlighted via ZimaBoard or CasaOS website or interface is beyond my understanding.</p><figure class=\"kg-card kg-image-card\"><img src=\"https://itsfoss.com/content/images/2024/03/icewhale-forum-zimaboard.webp\" class=\"kg-image\" alt=\"ZimaBoard Makes Owning a Homelab Super Easy\" loading=\"lazy\" width=\"1000\" height=\"516\" srcset=\"https://itsfoss.com/content/images/size/w600/2024/03/icewhale-forum-zimaboard.webp 600w, https://itsfoss.com/content/images/2024/03/icewhale-forum-zimaboard.webp 1000w\" sizes=\"(min-width: 720px) 720px\"></figure><p>That&apos;s not it. <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/@casaos?ref=itsfoss.com\">CasaOS has a YouTube channel</a> that has good instructional videos. But this YouTube channel is also not promoted to the end user.</p><p>There is also a <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/ZimaBoard/?ref=itsfoss.com\">dedicated subreddit</a> but not sure if the ZimaBoard support answers here.</p><p>You see, there are various documentation and support channels available but not properly promoted to the end user. It may leave some end users frustrated owing to a lack of support when there is plenty. </p><h2 id=\"what-i-like-in-zimaboard\">What I like in ZimaBoard</h2><p><strong><em>Pretty much all of it. </em></strong></p><p>It&apos;s a good-looking device. Unlike most single board computers out there, ZimaBoard doesn&apos;t show the naked board. It&apos;s covered in a well-designed case which looks super cool with that big heatsink and the gray, orange and black color combinations enhances its looks.</p><figure class=\"kg-card kg-image-card\"><img src=\"https://itsfoss.com/content/images/2024/03/zimaboard-closeup.webp\" class=\"kg-image\" alt=\"ZimaBoard Makes Owning a Homelab Super Easy\" loading=\"lazy\" width=\"1000\" height=\"750\" srcset=\"https://itsfoss.com/content/images/size/w600/2024/03/zimaboard-closeup.webp 600w, https://itsfoss.com/content/images/2024/03/zimaboard-closeup.webp 1000w\" sizes=\"(min-width: 720px) 720px\"></figure><p>Perhaps it&apos;s the heatsink or the device capability but <strong>it doesn&apos;t heat up easily</strong>, certainly not like Raspberry Pi. I kept it powered on for a few days continuously and the device was still not heating. I ran a few applications with Jellyfin server streaming on the TV and the device temperature stayed in the 40s.</p><p>Another thing I like it that <strong>it doesn&apos;t consume much power</strong>, just 6W at the most. This is important if you plan to <strong>keep the device plugged in 24&#xD7;7</strong>.</p><figure class=\"kg-card kg-image-card kg-card-hascaption\"><img src=\"https://itsfoss.com/content/images/2024/03/zimaboard-running-jellyfin-on-tv.webp\" class=\"kg-image\" alt=\"ZimaBoard Makes Owning a Homelab Super Easy\" loading=\"lazy\" width=\"1200\" height=\"900\" srcset=\"https://itsfoss.com/content/images/size/w600/2024/03/zimaboard-running-jellyfin-on-tv.webp 600w, https://itsfoss.com/content/images/size/w1000/2024/03/zimaboard-running-jellyfin-on-tv.webp 1000w, https://itsfoss.com/content/images/2024/03/zimaboard-running-jellyfin-on-tv.webp 1200w\" sizes=\"(min-width: 720px) 720px\"><figcaption><span style=\"white-space: pre-wrap;\">ZimaBoard running media server which is connected to Android TV</span></figcaption></figure><p>The docker based approach makes it easier to install and use open source software. Just a few clicks and you have the software running on your home server without worrying about configuration and networking etc.</p><p>There is a good collection of officially provided applications.

Not that you and I are going to do that.</p><h2 id=\"conclusion\">Conclusion</h2><p>I have been thinking of building my homelab for more than a year. I own a Raspberry Pi and a couple of more single board computers. But being a father to a toddler means I don&apos;t get enough spare time for these hobbies anymore.</p><p>Thanks to ZimaBoard, the desire to own a homelab is fulfilled. It&apos;s a plug and play device that lets you set things up pretty easily.</p><p>Of course, if you have free time and some technical skill, you can achieve the same by installing CasaOS on a spare computer. </p><p>But not everyone would want that. If you can afford to spend $150-$200, you get a dedicated Homelab device with a lot less effort. It&apos;s somewhat like owning a device like Apple TV or Roku.</p><p>For now, I am using ZimaBoard for Jellyfin media server, Snapdrop for wireless file transfer and PhotoPrism for photo library and I am loving it.</p><figure class=\"kg-card kg-image-card kg-card-hascaption\"><img src=\"https://itsfoss.com/content/images/2024/03/zimaboard-jellyfin-tv.webp\" class=\"kg-image\" alt=\"ZimaBoard Makes Owning a Homelab Super Easy\" loading=\"lazy\" width=\"1200\" height=\"900\" srcset=\"https://itsfoss.com/content/images/size/w600/2024/03/zimaboard-jellyfin-tv.webp 600w, https://itsfoss.com/content/images/size/w1000/2024/03/zimaboard-jellyfin-tv.webp 1000w, https://itsfoss.com/content/images/2024/03/zimaboard-jellyfin-tv.webp 1200w\" sizes=\"(min-width: 720px) 720px\"><figcaption><span style=\"white-space: pre-wrap;\">Jellyfin media server running on ZimaBoard while client running on my TV</span></figcaption></figure><p>It&apos;s an excellent device that would surely benefit from better documentation and support forum.</p>\n<!--kg-card-begin: html-->\n<div class=\"button-holder\">\n<!--kg-card-end: html-->\n<div class=\"kg-card kg-button-card kg-align-center\"><a href=\"https://amzn.to/4ad43RA?ref=itsfoss.com\" class=\"kg-btn kg-btn-accent\">ZimaBoard on Amazon</a></div><div class=\"kg-card kg-button-card kg-align-center\"><a href=\"https://shop.zimaboard.com/products/zimaboard-single-board-server?ref=itsfoss.com\" class=\"kg-btn kg-btn-accent\">ZimaBoard Official Shop</a></div>\n<!--kg-card-begin: html-->\n</div>\n<!--kg-card-end: html-->\n<p>&#x1F5E8;&#xFE0F; Do you own a ZimaBoard or plan to own one?

It aims to give you an out-of-the-box homelab experience and it succeeds in that purpose.ZimaBoard💡To summarize, here are my thoughts on ZimaBoard✅ Out of the box homelab experience✅ Easy deployment of various applications through CasaOS web interface✅ Great looking device in a small form factor✅ Does not heat up even under heavy load✅ Intel x86 processor instead of ARM (allows running most distros)✅ Reasonably priced❎ The documentation could be improvedIf that sounds exciting, read on to learn my experience and views in detail.ZimaBoard specificationsThere are three variants of ZimaBoard; ZimaBoard 232/432/832. They are primarily categorized based on RAM configuration and the processor used.CPU: Intel Celeron N3350 Dual Core 1.1-2.4GHz (232 Model), or Intel Celeron N3450 Quad Core 1.1-2.2GHz (432 & 832 Model)RAM: 2G (232 Model), 4G (432 Model) and 8G (832 Model) LPDDR4Onboard Storage: 32 GB eMMCHDD/SSD: 2x SATA 6.0 Gb/s PortsLAN: 2x GbE LAN PortsUSB: 2x USB 3.0PCle: 1x PCle 2.0 4xDisplay port: 1x Mini-DisplayPort 1.2 4k@60HzTDP: 6W (yes, it doesn't take much power)Dimensions: 138.7 W x 81.4 D x 34.9 H mmWeight: 278gPassive CoolingIntel VT-d, VT-x, AES-NISupports 4K video transcoding for H.264 (AVC), H.265 (HEVC), MPEG-2, VC-1Pre-installed OS: CasaOS (Based on Debian)Compatible OS: Linux, Windows, OpenWrt, pfSense, Android, LibreelecZimaBoard is priced at $119.9 for 2 GB variant, $159.9 for 4 GB variant and $199.9 for the 8 GB variant.ZimaBoardI am using the 8 GB variant for this review.ZimaBoard model 832 on my deskHardware highlightsThere are two Gigabit Ethernet ports to allow you to use ZimaBoard as a router or firewall.There are also two dedicated SATA ports to connect your HDDs for backups, NAS and more. The PCle port gives you the option to add additional hardware. There is no WiFi adapter in-built here. It is supposed to be connected via Ethernet. Moreover, it has Intel N3450 processor which was released some years ago, although it works superb.What can you do with ZimaBoard?A lot but in small form factor and ideally in a home setup.You can use it as a media server with software like Jellyfin, Plex and Emby. You can even connect it your TV for media streaming.You can also use it as a router with openWrt or as a firewall with pfSense or secure your network with VPN. It can also be used for build a smart home system with Home Assistant.You can attach up to 32 TB of storage thanks to its two SATA ports and a PCle port. Did someone say NAS? Yes, that's possible too.Use it for your personal cloud storage thanks to tools like PhotoPrism and Nextcloud.The device consumed only 6W of power and it hardly heats up. Making it ideal for 24x7 operation.The open source software deployment and managing your ZimaBoard is done through its Debian-based distro CasaOS. Which I am going to discuss in the next section.CasaOS makes ZimaBoard a Plug and Play Homelab deviceZimaBoard comes with its own operating system CasaOS preinstalled. The thing about CasaOS is that you can access it via a web browser from your regular computer. Yes, you don't need to connect ZimaBoard to a dedicated screen or SSH into it to use it (you can do that, though).So, the first time you use ZimaBoard, you connect it to the Ethernet port of your router and turn it on. After a minute or so, you can access the CasaOS interface in your web browser by typing http://casaos.local.At the first run, it asks you to create a user account and password. This adds a security layer otherwise anyone on your sub network could access CasaOS and modify its configuration.You have to create user account on first run of CasaOsThe CasaOS web interface is quite simple. It shows the current system usage, disk storage and currently installed applications. Not only that, you can also see the current CPU temperature and power usage.CasaOS dashboardIt also lets you access an App store and deploy new open source software easily within minutes.CasaOS App StoreHow does that happen? Well, the applications actually run in Docker containers. When you install a software from this App Store, you are fetching a preconfigured docker image and run a container. Installing PhotoPrism on ZimaBoard's CasaOSYou can access the running software on the same IP as your ZimaBoard but on different ports. For example, the Jellyfin server runs on port 8097 and PhotoPrism runs on port 2342 in my case.Jellyfin server running on port 8097Updating and removing applications is also quite easy. On the dashboard, click the three dots on the installed application and it presents you with the option to check and update, remove it, restart it or just stop the application. Of course, you also get the option to access the settings of the docker container running the application.Overall, this is an easy-to-use interface for any kind of user. It makes using ZimaBoard an ease. Install the available open source software from the store, set it up a little for the first run and access it from the devices on your sub-network.💡I discovered a cool feature in CasaOS. The 'Tips' option you see for an installed app often displays the default username and password. Not only this, you can also edit this field to add your own notes to it.It's not all smooth ride, though. I did noticed a few things that should be improved. Let me share them.Hiccups I encounteredThe issues I came across were not dealbreakers but I wanted to let you know that like any gadget and operating system, you may stumble upon a few problems.For example, I feel that it takes 2 minutes or so after powering on to access ZimaBoard via casaos.local in the browser.I discovered kind of a bug in the UI while shutting down the OS from the web browser. It showed 'Now shutting down' message and it just kept on going like that. It was unclear if CasaOS was shutdown or not so I refreshed the browser and it shows 'failed to load apps, please refresh later'.It's a tiny thing but I think this could have been handled a little better so that a user would know if the shutdown is complete.Even restarting apps (running in Docker containers) takes a lot more time than what it would be if it was forced stopped via docker commands. Restarting or stopping apps shows action in progress but needs a manual refresh of the CasaOS in the browser.Another hiccup was accessing CasaOS via SSH. Remember, I told you that I had to create a user account on the first run? I thought the same details will be used for SSH access. But no, CasaOS has SSH access enabled with username casaos and password casaos. I don't like default username and passwords for SSH. It's a security risk. SSH should be accessed via the user account created at first login.Achilles heel: documentation and support platformIt's there but it's not obvious to find it.ZimaBoard should improve the documentation for the apps a bit for new users. For example, I had trouble adding the USB to my Jellyfin server. Every app runs in a container and so it needed to be added to the Jellyfin setting at container level. This kind of information could be added through the tooltip that takes the documentation of the app.Currently, things are scattered and not properly communicated to the end user. IceWhale is the parent company of ZimaBoard and CasaOS is the open source operating system created for ZimaBoard but can be used on other devices.Now, there is a wiki for CasaOS but it is incomplete and has not been updated recently. The wiki mentions a Discord channel for support but I prefer a forum for community led support. This way, instead of asking, the end users can search for the problems that might have been faced by others in the past. Saves the redundancy.There is a community forum under IceWhale brand and it supposedly serves ZimaBoard, CasaOS, ZimaBlade and other Zima devices. Why it is not highlighted via ZimaBoard or CasaOS website or interface is beyond my understanding.That's not it. CasaOS has a YouTube channel that has good instructional videos. But this YouTube channel is also not promoted to the end user.There is also a dedicated subreddit but not sure if the ZimaBoard support answers here.You see, there are various documentation and support channels available but not properly promoted to the end user. It may leave some end users frustrated owing to a lack of support when there is plenty. What I like in ZimaBoardPretty much all of it. It's a good-looking device. Unlike most single board computers out there, ZimaBoard doesn't show the naked board. It's covered in a well-designed case which looks super cool with that big heatsink and the gray, orange and black color combinations enhances its looks.Perhaps it's the heatsink or the device capability but it doesn't heat up easily, certainly not like Raspberry Pi. I kept it powered on for a few days continuously and the device was still not heating. I ran a few applications with Jellyfin server streaming on the TV and the device temperature stayed in the 40s.Another thing I like it that it doesn't consume much power, just 6W at the most. This is important if you plan to keep the device plugged in 24×7.ZimaBoard running media server which is connected to Android TVThe docker based approach makes it easier to install and use open source software. Just a few clicks and you have the software running on your home server without worrying about configuration and networking etc.There is a good collection of officially provided applications. If you need more, there are third party app stores that can be utilized.Since it's an Intel board, you can also run Windows on it. Not that you and I are going to do that.ConclusionI have been thinking of building my homelab for more than a year. I own a Raspberry Pi and a couple of more single board computers. But being a father to a toddler means I don't get enough spare time for these hobbies anymore.Thanks to ZimaBoard, the desire to own a homelab is fulfilled. It's a plug and play device that lets you set things up pretty easily.Of course, if you have free time and some technical skill, you can achieve the same by installing CasaOS on a spare computer. But not everyone would want that. If you can afford to spend $150-$200, you get a dedicated Homelab device with a lot less effort. It's somewhat like owning a device like Apple TV or Roku.For now, I am using ZimaBoard for Jellyfin media server, Snapdrop for wireless file transfer and PhotoPrism for photo library and I am loving it.Jellyfin media server running on ZimaBoard while client running on my TVIt's an excellent device that would surely benefit from better documentation and support forum.\n\n\n\nZimaBoard on AmazonZimaBoard Official Shop\n\n\n\n🗨️ Do you own a ZimaBoard or plan to own one?

You can set static IP on the Raspberry Pi itselfYou can have your router assign a static IP to the PiBoth methods have their pros and cons.Let's say you set the static IP on the Raspberry Pi. Your Pi will always seek the same IP address from the router (let's say 192.168.1.51). That's fine as long as the router remains the same.

So, I'll discuss how you can set static IP on the Raspberry Pi itself.Setting static IP on Raspberry PiThe procedure comprises the following four steps:Get the current IP address of the Pi (if you want to use this one as static IP)Get the gateway IP (router's IP)Get the DNS server address (optional)Use the above information to change network configurationThe first three steps can be easily done in the command line. The third step can be done easily in both the command line and GUI.📑Make sure that your Pi is connected to the router. You can also follow these steps if you connect to Pi via SSH.Step 1: Get the IP address of PiIf you want to use the current IP address as the static IP,This is very simple. In the terminal, type the following command:hostname -IYou may also use this command:ip aBoth will give you the current IP address of the Raspberry Pi. As you can see in the screenshot above, my Raspberry Pi's IP address is 192.168.1.34.Step 2: Get the gateway IPThis is also quite simple. To get the gateway IP address (your router's IP address), use this command:ip route | grep defaultAs you can see in the screenshot below, the gateway IP in my case is 192.168.1.1.Step 3: Get the DNS server details (optional)Some people like to keep the same DNS server which is currently being used on the system. I think you can do without that as well. Most home users have the DHCP server handle it automatically anyway.Still, if you want, you can get the DNS server address with:grep nameserver /etc/resolv.conf📋By now you must have realized that you set static IP for a particular network connection.

Step 4 (Terminal Method): Change network configuration to set static IPIf you are accessing Raspberry Pi via SSH or if you prefer the command line, you can use the nmtui (network manager in terminal) tool.✋These steps have been tested on Raspberry Pi 5. If your system doesn't have nmtui package installed, you may install it and continue following the instructions.Run this command:sudo nmtuiYou'll see an interface like this.

Simply edit the network connection in question again. This time, change the IPv4 configuration to 'automatic' and save your changes. And that's it. You don't have to provide IP address, gateway IP etc anymore.ConclusionAs I mentioned at the beginning of this tutorial, you should use a static IP from the router end specially if your Pi won't be easily accessed physically.But if your device is in your hands all the time, you have the liberty of accessing and changing its configuration.

How to install ADB and Fastboot on Linux You get adb and fastboot available in the default repository of almost every modern Linux distribution and it does not require any third-party repository. So let's take a look at how those two packages can be installed on various Linux distributions. For Ubuntu/Debian:sudo apt install adb fastbootFor Fedora Linux:sudo dnf install android-toolsFor Arch Linux:sudo pacman -S android-toolsThat's it. Once you are done with the installation, you can check the installed version of adb using the following command:adb --version🚧Please note that some manufacturers do not like unlocking bootloader.

How do you use it for your use-case? Please let me know in the comments.</em></p>","snippet":"If you are using any popular Linux distribution including Debian, Ubuntu, Arch, openSUSE, or Fedora, your system uses systemd as its init system. Sure, there are controversies surrounding systemd. But, it is the most used init system.In a systemd-equipped distro, there is a command that could make your life easy. It is the systemctl command, used to interact with the systemd init service. System administrators always use this command, but it is also useful for end-users wishing to take control via the terminal. For instance, you can use the systemctl command to list services in Linux.So in this tutorial, I will walk you through all the essentials you need to learn to use the systemctl command:The basic syntax and common flags.Practical examples of the command.Practice questions to get better at using the systemctl command.Here's How to Use The Systemctl Command To use the systemctl command, it is important to learn the syntax and available options.Here's how the syntax looks like:systemctl <command> <service_name>Here,<command>: this is where you specify the action you want to execute over the service such as stop, start, etc. <service_name>: this is where you specify the name of the service that you would like to work with.To manage services, you have various commands to use with the systemctl command, here's a list of one of the most useful ones:\n\n\n\n\nCommand\nDescription\n\n\n\n\nsystemctl start [service]\nStart a service and run it in the background.\n\n\nsystemctl stop [service]\nStop a currently running service.\n\n\nsystemctl enable [service]\nConfigure a service to start automatically at system boot.\n\n\nsystemctl disable [service]\nConfigure a service to not start automatically at system boot.\n\n\nsystemctl status [service]\nDisplay the current status (running, stopped, etc.) of a service.\n\n\nsystemctl restart [service]\nStop a running service and then start it again.\n\n\nsystemctl reload [service]\nReload the configuration of a service without stopping it.\n\n\nsystemctl mask [service]\nPrevent a service from being started, even manually.\n\n\nsystemctl unmask [service]\nAllow a previously masked service to be started.\n\n\nsystemctl set-default [target]\nChange the default system target (runlevel) for the next boot.\n\n\nsystemctl list-unit-files\nList all installed unit files and their current state (enabled/disabled).\n\n\nsystemctl list-dependencies [unit]\nShow the dependencies (other units) required for a specific unit.\n\n\nsystemctl list-sockets\nList all active sockets (for inter-process communication).\n\n\nsystemctl list-jobs\nShow all currently active systemd jobs (ongoing operations).\n\n\nsystemctl list-units\nList all loaded and active systemd units (services, sockets, etc.).\n\n\n\n\nNow, let's take a look at some practical examples of the systemctl command.Practical examples of the systemctl commandIn this section, I share some practical examples of the systemctl command, ranging from the basics to the advanced ones. Let's start with how you can start your service. 1. Start a service In most cases, the installed service gets activated by default, but there are times when you are required to do that manually. To start a service, you need to use the start flag with the systemctl command and append the name of the service, as shown here:sudo systemctl start <service_name>Let's say I want to start the Apache server, I'll be using the following:sudo systemctl start apache22. Enable a service When you start a service, it will only be effective until the next boot. This means the service will be turned off when you reboot your system.To tackle this situation, you want a service to start automatically when you boot your system and for that purpose, you can use the enable flag as shown here:sudo systemctl enable <service_name>For example, if I want to enable Apache service, then I'll use the following:sudo systemctl enable apache23. Stop a serviceWhen you intend to modify an active service, the first step you have to perform is to stop the service and for that purpose, you use the stop flag as shown here:sudo systemctl stop <service_name>For example, here's how you stop the Apache service:sudo systemctl stop apache2Suggested Read 📖Start, Stop & Restart Services in Ubuntu and Other LinuxYou can easily manage service with systemd and init. Learn to start, stop and restart services in Ubuntu and other Linux Distributions.It's FOSSSergiu4. Disable a serviceIf you've enabled a service in the past, and now you don't want it to be active at every system boot, you can disable it. To disable a service, you use the disable flag as shown here:sudo systemctl disable <service_name>To disable the Apache service, I use the following command:sudo systemctl disable apache25. Check the status of a service Checking the status before performing any action over a service is highly recommended and can save you a lot of time. To check the status of a service, all you have to do is append the name of the service to the status flag as shown here:systemctl status <service_name>Here, I check the status of the Apache service:systemctl status apache2As I disabled the Apache service earlier, the above output suggests that the service is disabled. But depending on your service, you may receive a different status of the service, and here's what it means:\n\n\n\n\nStatus\nDescription\n\n\n\n\nactive (running)\nThe service is currently running in the background.\n\n\nactive (exited)\nThe service was a one-time or periodic task that has completed its execution.\n\n\nactive (waiting)\nThe service is running but waiting for a specific event or condition to occur before proceeding.\n\n\ninactive\nThe service is not currently running.\n\n\nenabled\nThe service is configured to start automatically when the system boots up.\n\n\ndisabled\nThe service is configured to not start automatically at system boot.\n\n\nstatic\nThis service cannot be managed by systemd or the systemctl command; it needs to be managed manually.\n\n\nmasked\nThe service is masked, which means it is prevented from being started (needs to be unmasked before it can run).\n\n\nalias\nThe service name is an alias, and the service is a symbolic link pointing to another unit file.\n\n\nlinked\nThe service or unit file is symbolically linked to another unit file.\n\n\n\n\n6. Restart a service Once you modify the service configuration, or if it is not responding, then restarting a service can be helpful.To restart a service, you use the restart flag as shown here:sudo systemctl restart <service_name>For example, my Apache server was not responding, so if I were to restart the service, then I use the following command:sudo systemctl restart apache2Related Read 📖14 Systemd-Free Linux Distributionssystemd has been adopted by most major Linux distribution. If you don’t like systemd at all, here are the alternative Linux distros for you.It's FOSSAnkush Das7. Reload a service You reload a service when you make changes to the service configuration, and you want to apply changes without restarting the entire service. To reload a service, you use the reload flag as shown here:sudo systemctl reload <service_name>For example, I made a few changes to the Apache service and now if I were to reload the Apache service, here is what I type in the terminal:sudo systemctl reload apache28. Mask a service Masking a service is the most efficient way to prevent that service from being started, either manually or automatically, during system boot.Think of it as a more robust version of stopping the service 😉.To mask a service, you use the mask flag as shown here:sudo systemctl mask <service_name>Here's how the command would look for the Apache service:sudo systemctl mask apache2Whenever you mask the service, you see a symlink created which redirects the service's configuration file to the null device (/dev/null). This means you cannot start the service by any means until it is unmasked. 9. Unmask a service If you want to start the masked service, it needs to be unmasked first! To unmask a service, you use the unmask flag as shown here:sudo systemctl unmask <service_name>Just type in the command like this:sudo systemctl unmask apache2As you can see, it removed the symlink pointing to /dev/null.10. Set the default targetSetting a default target refers to changing the default operational mode or runlevel that the system will enter after booting up.One good example of setting a default target is to choose the user interface to boot, such as you can either boot to CLI mode or GUI.To set a default target, you use the set-default flag as shown here:sudo systemctl set-default <target-name>For example, if you want to boot into the GUI, then I will set the default target to graphical.target as shown here:sudo systemctl set-default graphical.targetApart from the GUI target, you have other options as well:\n\n\n\n\nTarget\nDescription\n\n\n\n\nmulti-user.target\nThis target starts the system with networking enabled, suitable for servers or non-graphical workstations.\n\n\nrescue.target\nThis target is useful for system recovery or troubleshooting when the system cannot boot into the regular multi-user mode.\n\n\nemergency.target\nThis target provides an emergency environment for system maintenance or repair when the system is in a critically broken state.\n\n\nreboot.target\nThis is typically used for one-time reboots or in automated scripts.\n\n\npoweroff.target\nThis is typically used for one-time shutdowns or in automated scripts.\n\n\nhibernate.target\nSets the system to hibernate (save system state to disk and power off) as the default target, Only available if the system supports hibernation.\n\n\nhybrid-sleep.target\nSets the system to enter a hybrid sleep mode (a combination of hibernation and sleep) as the default target, Only available if the system supports hybrid sleep.\n\n\n\n\nSuggested Read 📖How to List Services in LinuxChecking the service status is one of the first few steps for troubleshooting a Linux system.

Here is a recap of the experience.\n\n\n\nOSS awareness is growing\n\n\n\nAttending OFE was an opportunity to witness some of the dynamics that define European regulations and policies with regard to free and open source software. \n\n\n\nMost of the focus was on open source as a means to aid economic development and maximize the value of public investment in technology. Another widely discussed topic was the CRA (Cyber Resilience Act), and the implications on open source projects.\n\n\n\nOFE location: the Royal Flemish Theatre.\n\n\n\nSeveral well-known free software organizations were present (Apache Foundation, Eclipse Foundation, Linux Foundation, NLnet Foundation, etc) next to figures from various European governance organizations, as well as and handful of free software contributors and developers.\n\n\n\nIt was useful to connect with new with people and listen to new voices. Despite the complexities that come with long-term planning and European politics, the future for open source looks bright!\n\n\n\nFOSDEM\n\n\n\nEvery year, thousands of developers of free and open source software from all over the world gather at FOSDEM. It’s like an open source festival! Attending FOSDEM allowed reconnecting in real life with project like Godot, Matrix, Thunderbird, Kdenlive, Freecad and many more. \n\n\n\nThe connection that Blender has with the open source community must be fostered and the Blender project should look into being more visible in this event in the coming years.\n\n\n\nUpcoming Events\n\n\n\nThis was a great start of the year, with many events such as GDC, BCONLA and Annecy to look forward to.

data-wpel-link=\"external\"><strong>Casa Flix</strong></a> is an attic renovation near Calleo square that turned a dark compact space into a flexible, light-filled home for urban life. The 42-square-meter apartment (approximately 452 square feet), overhauled by <a href=\"https://design-milk.com/tag/gon-architects/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\" data-wpel-link=\"internal\"><strong>gon architects</strong></a>, offers a unique vantage point hovering above the city on the sixth floor in a historic building dating back to 1900. With its sloped roof and unconventional layout, it presented both challenges and opportunities for transformation. The overall vision was to maximize space while enhancing functionality and aesthetic appeal. The original layout, consisting of two rooms, was reimagined to create four distinct spacial areas that are visually connected: the bedroom/dressing area, entrance, workspace/bathroom, and the kitchen/living/dining room.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://design-milk.com/?attachment_id=539201\" rel=\"attachment wp-att-539201\" data-wpel-link=\"internal\"><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" class=\"alignnone size-large wp-image-539201\" src=\"https://design-milk.com/images/2024/03/Casa-Flix-Attic-Apartment-Gon-Architects-2-810x1013.jpg\" alt=\"Modern office space with vibrant color accents and a minimalist design.\" width=\"810\" height=\"1013\" srcset=\"https://design-milk.com/images/2024/03/Casa-Flix-Attic-Apartment-Gon-Architects-2-810x1013.jpg 810w, https://design-milk.com/images/2024/03/Casa-Flix-Attic-Apartment-Gon-Architects-2-800x1000.jpg 800w, https://design-milk.com/images/2024/03/Casa-Flix-Attic-Apartment-Gon-Architects-2-768x960.jpg 768w, https://design-milk.com/images/2024/03/Casa-Flix-Attic-Apartment-Gon-Architects-2-1229x1536.jpg 1229w, https://design-milk.com/images/2024/03/Casa-Flix-Attic-Apartment-Gon-Architects-2.jpg 1280w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 810px) 100vw, 810px\" /></a></p>\n<p>The entrance, reminiscent of a ship&#8217;s interior, sets the tone for the rest of the attic. A blue tunnel leads into the apartment, flanked by a metal shelf and circular window, creating a sense of transition and a taste of what&#8217;s to come. The bathroom, nestled in the center of the home, separates the sink and toilet from the shower.

square that turned a dark compact space into a flexible, light-filled home for urban life. The 42-square-meter apartment (approximately 452 square feet), overhauled by gon architects, offers a unique vantage point hovering above the city on the sixth floor in a historic building dating back to 1900. With its sloped roof and unconventional layout, it presented both challenges and opportunities for transformation. The overall vision was to maximize space while enhancing functionality and aesthetic appeal. The original layout, consisting of two rooms, was reimagined to create four distinct spacial areas that are visually connected: the bedroom/dressing area, entrance, workspace/bathroom, and the kitchen/living/dining room.\n\nThe entrance, reminiscent of a ship’s interior, sets the tone for the rest of the attic. A blue tunnel leads into the apartment, flanked by a metal shelf and circular window, creating a sense of transition and a taste of what’s to come. The bathroom, nestled in the center of the home, separates the sink and toilet from the shower. Mirrored panels, which conceal the sink and toilet part, cleverly expand the perception of space by offering reflections that change depending on if the door is open, half open, or closed. A glass block wall in the shower allows natural light to filter through, balancing privacy with luminosity.\n\nA partial wall painted green is the backdrop for a triangular desk that juts out from the wall and paired with an orange chair from Moustache.\n\n\n\nThe pale yellow kitchen cabinets run along the higher end of the sloped ceiling with the vibrant blue dining table placed under the lower side. In addition to storing various kitchen accessories, cleaning products, and appliances, the cabinets also hold the owner’s clothes.\n\n\n\nTo counteract the inherent challenges of attic living, gon architects introduces ways to maximize natural light and ventilation. Additional skylights are installed in the bedroom and living room, flooding the interior with sunlight and creating an airy ambiance. A transparent glass door at the entrance further enhances the sense of openness, allowing light to permeate throughout the apartment.\n\nWhen night falls, the glass-blocked shower becomes illuminated like a lantern, casting a glow throughout the entire space.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWhile bold colors mix with mostly white surfaces in the rest of the apartment, the bedroom is void of all hues for resulting in a serene, minimalist space.\n\n\n\n\nBefore photos\nPhotography by Imagen Subliminal (Miguel de Guzmán + Rocío Romero).\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t","creator":"Caroline Williamson","hasRead":true,"starred":false,"hidden":false,"notify":false},{"_id":169,"source":10,"title":"Introducing MO.CA: The Future of Sustainable Living in a Mobile Home","link":"https://design-milk.com/introducing-mo-ca-the-future-of-sustainable-living-in-a-mobile-home/?utm_source=rss&utm_medium=rss&utm_campaign=introducing-mo-ca-the-future-of-sustainable-living-in-a-mobile-home","date":"2024-04-02T17:00:33.000Z","fetchedDate":"2024-04-20T08:53:51.650Z","thumb":"https://design-milk.com/images/2024/03/IAAC-MO.CA-Mobile-Catalyst-Eco-Mobile-Home-1-810x540.jpg","content":"\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<p><a href=\"https://design-milk.com/introducing-mo-ca-the-future-of-sustainable-living-in-a-mobile-home/iaac-mo-ca-mobile-catalyst-eco-mobile-home-1/\" data-wpel-link=\"internal\"><img src=\"https://design-milk.com/images/2024/03/IAAC-MO.CA-Mobile-Catalyst-Eco-Mobile-Home-1-810x540.jpg\" alt=\"Introducing MO.CA: The Future of Sustainable Living in a Mobile Home\" /></a></p>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<p>In a world where sustainability and mobility are becoming increasingly important, the <a href=\"https://iaac.net/research-departments/valldaura-self-sufficient-labs/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener external noreferrer\" data-wpel-link=\"external\"><strong>Institute for Advanced Architecture of Catalonia (IAAC)</strong></a> has unveiled a groundbreaking project – <a href=\"https://blog.iaac.net/mo-ca-final-thesis-design/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener external noreferrer\" data-wpel-link=\"external\"><strong>MO.CA (MOBILE CATALYST)</strong></a>.

From this underground level, the staircase eventually leads to the roof terrace, which boasts panoramic views of Gangnam, the heart of Seoul.\nWith the completion of this project, Kinzo effectively translates PUBG Studios’ fantastical narratives into a working office design for an immersive environment that fully reflects the virtual worlds the employees build.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTo see more of the firm’s work visit kinzo-berlin.de.\nImages courtesy of KRAFTON.\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t","creator":"Vy Yang","hasRead":true,"starred":false,"hidden":false,"notify":false},{"_id":171,"source":10,"title":"The kodo hotel Is an Architectural Touchstone for Wellness","link":"https://design-milk.com/the-kodo-hotel-is-an-architectural-touchstone-for-wellness/?utm_source=rss&utm_medium=rss&utm_campaign=the-kodo-hotel-is-an-architectural-touchstone-for-wellness","date":"2024-04-04T17:00:15.000Z","fetchedDate":"2024-04-20T08:53:51.650Z","thumb":"https://design-milk.com/images/2024/04/Kodo-Hotel-Gry-Space-MRoyce-Architecture-00-hero-810x540.jpg","content":"\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<p><a href=\"https://design-milk.com/the-kodo-hotel-is-an-architectural-touchstone-for-wellness/kodo-hotel-gry-space-mroyce-architecture-00-hero/\" data-wpel-link=\"internal\"><img src=\"https://design-milk.com/images/2024/04/Kodo-Hotel-Gry-Space-MRoyce-Architecture-00-hero-810x540.jpg\" alt=\"The kodo hotel Is an Architectural Touchstone for Wellness\" /></a></p>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<p>Calcium, iron, sulfur, and magnesium.

Formerly a fire station from the 1920s, interior designers Jen Whitaker and Emi Kitawaki of Gry Space, along with architect Matt Royce of his eponymous practice, usher in a new era. Led by the spirit of omentanashi – reframing hospitality concepts to center around care rather than expectation – the structure is stripped of pomp and circumstance often associated with boutique hotels to focus on the power of intentional design decisions like indirect lighting, purposeful objects, and moments where negative space allows for pause.</p>\n<p><a

layered atop ash wood furniture, soft-toned interiors that are melancholic rather than somber, and a selection of rare Japanese botanicals. “​​At the core, we are rooted in creating a mood, a feeling that offers calmness and beauty in darkness and solitude in quietness,” says the Gry Space duo. “Raw concrete furniture, giant boulders, kyoto-style gravel, raw steel plates, and countless other subtle touches conspire to create a high design.”</p>\n<p><a

These minerals are just a small sample from the shared elemental composition that links humans to the earth, and yet the hubris of man has led many builders astray from regularly honoring earthen materials. An exception to this rule, however, is the kodō hotel whose concept and creation are quite literally anchored by raw boulders brought on site. The commercial project’s ability to serve as an architectural touchstone for patrons is derived from the synergy between collaborators M Royce Architecture and creative studio Gry Space who harnessed the inherent power of wabi-sabi – the Japanese art of impermanence.\n\n\n\nLocated in the Arts District of Los Angeles, California – and the greater cultural context where wellness has been commodified beyond comparison – kodō practices humility at the behest of a client who envisioned a hotel and dining space nuanced in Japanese traditions. Formerly a fire station from the 1920s, interior designers Jen Whitaker and Emi Kitawaki of Gry Space, along with architect Matt Royce of his eponymous practice, usher in a new era. Led by the spirit of omentanashi – reframing hospitality concepts to center around care rather than expectation – the structure is stripped of pomp and circumstance often associated with boutique hotels to focus on the power of intentional design decisions like indirect lighting, purposeful objects, and moments where negative space allows for pause.\n\n\n\n\nReconnecting with self is facilitated by unadulterated finishes: massive stones that bear records of natural history, tatami detailing layered atop ash wood furniture, soft-toned interiors that are melancholic rather than somber, and a selection of rare Japanese botanicals. “​​At the core, we are rooted in creating a mood, a feeling that offers calmness and beauty in darkness and solitude in quietness,” says the Gry Space duo. “Raw concrete furniture, giant boulders, kyoto-style gravel, raw steel plates, and countless other subtle touches conspire to create a high design.”\n\n\n\n\nGuests are greeted on the main floor where an open check-in melds with an intimate cafe to initiate the first of many grounding rituals in the fully immersive experience. Coined the kodō cafe, the repurposed fire engine doors can activate the frontage for activities engaging the street. Tatami benches, custom coat racks, and low dining tables crafted by Japanese carpenters Kikka Works are juxtaposed in playful contrast to custom concrete furnishings by Wabi Products borne from this collaboration.\n\n\nAdjacent to the hotel proper is the kodō restaurant, an outdoor eatery with a fire pit lounge, omakase sushi bar, and a secluded private dining room – all of which serve to extend the intimacy established upon entry. The rough finish found gracing the walls of this greenhouse-like space leans into the beauty of imperfection – another tenet of wabi-sabi – presenting itself as the fine art architecture it used to be. At its nucleus is a custom constructed, 16-foot, monolithic, live-edge pine table surrounded by six benches that seat up to 20 diners. When not in use, some of the seating can be positioned upright and repurposed as pedestals to display art, ceramics, and food in another nod to impermanence.\n\n\n\n\nAtop the aforementioned programming is the upper floor, which hosts eight ryokan-style rooms reflective of a traditional Japanese inn.

As Design Principal at <a href=\"https://www.boothhansen.com/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener external noreferrer\" data-wpel-link=\"external\"><strong>Booth Hansen</strong></a>, which he founded in 1980, he&#8217;s in charge of the conceptual development of every project, taking all of these aspects into consideration.</p>\n<p>Originally from LaGrange, Illinois, Booth acquainted himself with Chicago’s architecture early on when accompanying his father, a patent attorney, to his office in The Rookery, a great building of the old Chicago School with an inspiring atrium and spiral staircase. Perhaps influenced by his father&#8217;s sketches, design was a natural fit for Booth, who had a knack for building things, typically wood furniture, but occasionally something more sculptural in nature. When it came time to choose a course of study, Booth wasn&#8217;t sure, eventually deciding upon Stanford University.</p>\n<div id=\"attachment_539454\" class=\"wp-caption alignnone\"><a href=\"https://design-milk.com/?attachment_id=539454\" rel=\"attachment wp-att-539454\" data-wpel-link=\"internal\"><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" class=\"wp-image-539454 size-large\" src=\"https://design-milk.com/images/2024/03/F5-Larry-Booth-Photo-Nathan-Kirkman-810x1013.jpg\" alt=\"Man in a white shirt standing behind an architectural model of a building complex.\" width=\"810\" height=\"1013\" srcset=\"https://design-milk.com/images/2024/03/F5-Larry-Booth-Photo-Nathan-Kirkman-810x1013.jpg 810w, https://design-milk.com/images/2024/03/F5-Larry-Booth-Photo-Nathan-Kirkman-800x1000.jpg 800w, https://design-milk.com/images/2024/03/F5-Larry-Booth-Photo-Nathan-Kirkman-768x960.jpg 768w, https://design-milk.com/images/2024/03/F5-Larry-Booth-Photo-Nathan-Kirkman-1229x1536.jpg 1229w, https://design-milk.com/images/2024/03/F5-Larry-Booth-Photo-Nathan-Kirkman.jpg 1280w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 810px) 100vw, 810px\" /></a><p class=\"wp-caption-text\">Larry Booth \\\\\\ Photo:<a href=\"https://www.instagram.com/nathankirkmanphoto/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener external noreferrer\" data-wpel-link=\"external\"> Nathan Kirkman</a></p></div>\n<p>&#8220;Architecture students were in the College of Arts and Sciences, where I got a liberal education while I also learned about practical design,&#8221; says Booth. &#8220;My aesthetic sense was sharpened in studio classes where I drew imagined buildings and could also experiment with sculpture. In both architecture and art, I developed an interest in relationships of geometric form.&#8221;</p>\n<p>The engineering courses Booth completed while in school, mainly to placate his father who championed technical skills, also made an impact. More specifically, John E. Arnold, a pioneer in &#8220;creative engineering.&#8221; The professor believed that those who excelled in technical skills could benefit further with the addition of inventive thinking, giving students the ability to confront a problem with a solution that had perhaps never been executed before. Students, as well as the companies Arnold consulted for, were taught to organize their thinking into a creative process: analysis, synthesis, and evaluation.</p>\n<p>&#8220;Arnold’s influence included his conviction that design, architectural or otherwise, should address &#8216;human values and the needs of society.&#8217; More modestly, architects should consider the preferences of the client in any project, which, bluntly speaking, were not high on the list of European-inspired modernists,&#8221; Booth shares. &#8220;But thinking of how people used buildings and how they would feel inside, this struck some California architects as a natural link between form and function.&#8221;</p>\n<p>Chicago’s cultural landscape continues to include Booth&#8217;s presence, having served on the boards of over a dozen institutions, including the Auditorium Theatre Council, The School of the Art Institute of Chicago, the Chicago Symphony Orchestra, the Goodman Theatre, and the Museum of Contemporary Art. He&#8217;s currently a Clinical Professor of Civil and Environmental Engineering and the Richard C. Halpern/Rise International Distinguished Architect in Residence at Northwestern University. Booth has also had the opportunity to be a visiting professor at the Harvard Graduate School of Design, the University of California, Berkeley, and the University of Illinois, as well as a lecturer at numerous colleges and universities.</p>\n<p>Today, Larry Booth joins us for <a href=\"https://design-milk.com/column/friday-five/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\" data-wpel-link=\"internal\"><strong>Friday Five</strong></a>!</p>\n<div id=\"attachment_539452\" class=\"wp-caption alignnone\"><a href=\"https://design-milk.com/?attachment_id=539452\" rel=\"attachment wp-att-539452\" data-wpel-link=\"internal\"><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" class=\"size-large wp-image-539452\" src=\"https://design-milk.com/images/2024/03/F5-Larry-Booth-Horseshoe-Bend-Courtesy-US-NPS-810x606.jpg\" alt=\"Aerial view of horseshoe bend, showing the colorado river winding around a rock formation in a desert landscape.\" width=\"810\" height=\"606\" srcset=\"https://design-milk.com/images/2024/03/F5-Larry-Booth-Horseshoe-Bend-Courtesy-US-NPS-810x606.jpg 810w, https://design-milk.com/images/2024/03/F5-Larry-Booth-Horseshoe-Bend-Courtesy-US-NPS-800x599.jpg 800w, https://design-milk.com/images/2024/03/F5-Larry-Booth-Horseshoe-Bend-Courtesy-US-NPS-768x575.jpg 768w, https://design-milk.com/images/2024/03/F5-Larry-Booth-Horseshoe-Bend-Courtesy-US-NPS.jpg 1280w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 810px) 100vw, 810px\" /></a><p class=\"wp-caption-text\">Photo: Courtesy of United States National Parks Service</p></div>\n<h2>1.

As Design Principal at Booth Hansen, which he founded in 1980, he’s in charge of the conceptual development of every project, taking all of these aspects into consideration.\nOriginally from LaGrange, Illinois, Booth acquainted himself with Chicago’s architecture early on when accompanying his father, a patent attorney, to his office in The Rookery, a great building of the old Chicago School with an inspiring atrium and spiral staircase. Perhaps influenced by his father’s sketches, design was a natural fit for Booth, who had a knack for building things, typically wood furniture, but occasionally something more sculptural in nature. When it came time to choose a course of study, Booth wasn’t sure, eventually deciding upon Stanford University.\nLarry Booth \\\\\\ Photo: Nathan Kirkman\n“Architecture students were in the College of Arts and Sciences, where I got a liberal education while I also learned about practical design,” says Booth. “My aesthetic sense was sharpened in studio classes where I drew imagined buildings and could also experiment with sculpture. In both architecture and art, I developed an interest in relationships of geometric form.”\nThe engineering courses Booth completed while in school, mainly to placate his father who championed technical skills, also made an impact. More specifically, John E. Arnold, a pioneer in “creative engineering.” The professor believed that those who excelled in technical skills could benefit further with the addition of inventive thinking, giving students the ability to confront a problem with a solution that had perhaps never been executed before. Students, as well as the companies Arnold consulted for, were taught to organize their thinking into a creative process: analysis, synthesis, and evaluation.\n“Arnold’s influence included his conviction that design, architectural or otherwise, should address ‘human values and the needs of society.’ More modestly, architects should consider the preferences of the client in any project, which, bluntly speaking, were not high on the list of European-inspired modernists,” Booth shares. “But thinking of how people used buildings and how they would feel inside, this struck some California architects as a natural link between form and function.”\nChicago’s cultural landscape continues to include Booth’s presence, having served on the boards of over a dozen institutions, including the Auditorium Theatre Council, The School of the Art Institute of Chicago, the Chicago Symphony Orchestra, the Goodman Theatre, and the Museum of Contemporary Art. He’s currently a Clinical Professor of Civil and Environmental Engineering and the Richard C. Halpern/Rise International Distinguished Architect in Residence at Northwestern University. Booth has also had the opportunity to be a visiting professor at the Harvard Graduate School of Design, the University of California, Berkeley, and the University of Illinois, as well as a lecturer at numerous colleges and universities.\nToday, Larry Booth joins us for Friday Five!\nPhoto: Courtesy of United States National Parks Service\n1.

This newly renovated 1920s center-hall colonial – dubbed the Ginko House – has undergone a major transformation, breathing new life into its historic bones while retaining some of its original charm. The 4,875-square-foot home had a large addition located at the rear, consisting of a kitchen, great room, and primary suite, that was flooded with natural light. Colleen Healey, of Colleen Healey Architecture, was tasked with bringing that same open, brightness to the original part of the house and to upgrade the finishes throughout to form a more cohesive aesthetic.\n\nThe six bedroom, seven bathroom house kept its stucco exterior, but Healey updated the dramatic entrance with new windows and wooden louvers for a modernized look. In addition to the front, the back was included in the scope with a new garden, pool, and patio. A small sunroom featuring sliding pocket doors and roll screens was added to connect the interior with the updated backyard for an indoor/outdoor lifestyle.\n\nBy opening up the center of the home, sight lines were formed to the pool and patio, while inviting natural light into the main living spaces. Two gray Bubble sofas from Roche Bobois add a playful touch to the living room, which is located adjacent to the wall of windows by the patio.\n\nDark textured finishes and blackened steel add depth and drama, lending a touch of modernity throughout\n\n\nWhite surfaces surround the jewel toned Soriana sofas from Cassina, which form a seating area around the textured steel fireplace in the den.\n\n\n\nThe open white metal staircase becomes a focal point against a wall of horizontally arranged mahogany wood slats that complement the louvers at the front entrance.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhotography by Jennifer Hughes.\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t","creator":"Caroline Williamson","hasRead":true,"starred":false,"hidden":false,"notify":false},{"_id":174,"source":10,"title":"Rockhill Construction Is a Steward for Craft in Chelsea Condo","link":"https://design-milk.com/rockhill-construction-is-a-steward-for-craft-in-chelsea-condo/?utm_source=rss&utm_medium=rss&utm_campaign=rockhill-construction-is-a-steward-for-craft-in-chelsea-condo","date":"2024-04-12T16:00:34.000Z","fetchedDate":"2024-04-20T08:53:51.649Z","thumb":"https://design-milk.com/images/2024/04/Chelsea-Condo-Rockhill-Construction-07-810x478.jpg","content":"\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<p><a href=\"https://design-milk.com/rockhill-construction-is-a-steward-for-craft-in-chelsea-condo/chelsea-condo-rockhill-construction-07/\" data-wpel-link=\"internal\"><img src=\"https://design-milk.com/images/2024/04/Chelsea-Condo-Rockhill-Construction-07-810x478.jpg\" alt=\"Rockhill Construction Is a Steward for Craft in Chelsea Condo\" /></a></p>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<p>While <em>star</em>-chitects bask in the glory of their completed projects, contractors and construction companies responsible for realizing those designs are often overlooked.

assembled this architectural machine whose mission is in service of humanity, where guests are immediately greeted upon entry to the elevator foyer by the first of several interventions, which begins with a built-in bench for daily rituals as homeowners come and go. The curvaceous form complements the body’s shape and borrows warmth from the refurbished oakwood floors as if it has cataloged a lifetime of homeowners.

And at no fault of their own, so too is the general public unaware of the difference between things like interior architecture and interior design – the articulation of functional space through building and the making of interior atmospheres through aesthetics, respectively. Manhattan-based Rockhill Construction, and their network of adept craftsmen, offer a masterclass in collaborative making with their Chelsea Condo project.\n\nThe roughly 3,000-square-foot, full-floor flat comprises three bedrooms, three full bathrooms, one half bath, laundry, a generous kitchen, and airy catch-all living spaces that can accommodate entertaining, offer respite from the din of city living, or host a late night charrette for the creatives who live there – all of this overlooking the High Line. Central to the concept, and subsequently material narrative, are the residents’ personalities. Studio LOVEISENOUGH – who translated those intangibles into an experiential interior architecture – entrusted that Rockhill Construction would imbue their handiwork with the same spirit.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTasked with unique requests, the builder assembled this architectural machine whose mission is in service of humanity, where guests are immediately greeted upon entry to the elevator foyer by the first of several interventions, which begins with a built-in bench for daily rituals as homeowners come and go. The curvaceous form complements the body’s shape and borrows warmth from the refurbished oakwood floors as if it has cataloged a lifetime of homeowners. Circulation through the residence is constantly cushioned by millwork, thresholds, and plaster wall finishes that beg one’s touch to linger. Leaning into the intimacy of space, a more private circulation corridor was created for concealed flow. In addition to Rockhill’s know-how, the ability to create custom millwork in-house made rerouting foot traffic and concealing building systems seamless with the design.\n\n\nThe kitchen elaborates on the warmth generated by the wood found at the entry and in the primary living spaces – and is exemplary of the construction company’s technical prowess. Vast swaths of muddied marble are contrasted with stainless steel custom cabinetry in a seemingly weathered finish that only adds to the home’s persona. The rounded corners of cabinet doors take their cues from the pattern established in the backsplash. The softened corners are created by cutting 404 stainless steel with a water jet, given a brush finish, and laminated to walnut substrates. Marble was also made kinetic with pivot hinges on stone doors to create an appliance garage. “Our technical team, capable of realizing the most remarkable solutions to design directives, proposed the assembly as a means to realize the soft close and touch latch design,” says Rockhill. “For me, personally, it was proof of concept that a shared vision can be realized.”\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThough the project passed through a variety of hands to arrive at this place – from conceptualization of interior architecture, through construction, and onto interior design and staging – Rockhill has been a steward for the space. “Somehow that apartment, which is so generous in its proportions, sitting up high over the Hudson, with subtle references to the Space Age and travel, comes alive while vacant, which makes it all the more poetic.

design again with their latest project entitled Vessel. Located in Singapore, this new condo apartment underwent renovations to add a loft structure and to tailor the design to the lifestyle needs of the young professional couple who owns it. The pair requested a loft to be added to the compact 41-square-meter space (approx. 441 square feet) with a 4.7-meter-high ceiling (approx. 15-1/2 feet tall) while retaining the existing floor finishes, kitchen, and bathroom for both financial and sustainability reasons.\n\nUpon entering the condo, visitors are greeted by a linear kitchen running along the left side of the hallway. The loft, which has a lower soffit height than the corridor, is visible from the entryway creating a sense of anticipation and spatial depth from the start. The integration of LED strip lights, along the ribbed joinery on the bottom of the loft, enhances the overall ambience of the small living room underneath it and beyond.\n\nThe loft resides above the living room, which is reached by a clever wood box staircase comprising alternating half steps. The steep angle of the design requires a much smaller footprint than a typical staircase. Space under the stairs was not wasted; Metre Architects added a wall of storage accessed with push-to-open mechanisms that allow the panels to rest flush against the wall without the need for pulls or knobs.\n\n\n\nThe loft houses the couple’s home office along one wall with views of the backyard out of their double-height wall of windows on the other side. Amongst the lush greenery in the back, the apartment has a garden patio to enjoy time outdoors.\n\n\n\nA pair of floor recliners in the living room are used in lieu of a larger, traditional sofa to save on space. The original wall that divided the living room from the bedroom has been replaced with sliding fluted-glass doors, allowing for a seamless integration (or separation) of the two spaces as needed. The textured glass allows natural light to pass through while offering the couple privacy when they desire it.\n\n\n\n\nThe Vessel loft, reminiscent of the construction of a boat, serves as the metaphorical ship that supports the owners through their current phase of life while offering the potential for future occupants to embark on their own journeys within its walls.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhotography by Shiya Creative Studio.\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t","creator":"Caroline Williamson","hasRead":true,"starred":false,"hidden":false,"notify":false},{"_id":176,"source":10,"title":"Mindful Updates Retain Heritage in Vancouver Home Modernization","link":"https://design-milk.com/mindful-updates-retain-heritage-in-vancouver-home-modernization/?utm_source=rss&utm_medium=rss&utm_campaign=mindful-updates-retain-heritage-in-vancouver-home-modernization","date":"2024-04-16T17:00:14.000Z","fetchedDate":"2024-04-20T08:53:51.648Z","thumb":"https://design-milk.com/images/2024/04/Vancouver-House-00-Measured-Architecture-Paul-Sangha-Creative-landscaping-810x540.jpg","content":"\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<p><a href=\"https://design-milk.com/mindful-updates-retain-heritage-in-vancouver-home-modernization/vancouver-house-00-measured-architecture-paul-sangha-creative-landscaping/\" data-wpel-link=\"internal\"><img src=\"https://design-milk.com/images/2024/04/Vancouver-House-00-Measured-Architecture-Paul-Sangha-Creative-landscaping-810x540.jpg\" alt=\"Mindful Updates Retain Heritage in Vancouver Home Modernization\" /></a></p>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<p>Stitched into a 1910 Edwardian-era structure in the historic Shaughnessy neighborhood of Vancouver, British Columbia, Canada is a series of contemporary interventions by <strong><a href=\"https://measured.ca\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener external noreferrer\" data-wpel-link=\"external\">Measured Architecture</a></strong> working in tandem with landscape architecture by <a href=\"https://paulsangha.com\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener external noreferrer\" data-wpel-link=\"external\"><strong>Paul Sangha Creative</strong></a> landscaping.

The structure is now anchored by a grand, four-story blackened-metal central stair showcasing warm wood paneling, an adjacent glass atrium that acts like a light well, and multi-level privacy curtain system designed in collaboration with local artisan <a href=\"https://www.clothstudio.ca\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener external noreferrer\" data-wpel-link=\"external\">Cloth Studio</a>.

While the front facade maintains the integrity of its historical milieu, the rear delights in reinterpreting it. The central volume is expressed by uninterrupted floor-to-ceiling windows that crown with an enclosed glass cupola on the top floor reminiscent of the widow’s walks popular in the home’s aesthetic heyday. This vertical stacking also creates lines of continuation that meet those generated by the infinity pool as the yard reaches the domicile. In playful contrast to the residence – rather than a bastardization of historical elements – is a modern, steel-clad cubic structure situated a short distance from the main dwelling and perpendicular to the infinity pool. The upper portion is clad in mirrored surfaces, which help camouflage the unit while visually enhancing the yard’s depth. Below is a pool house in the style of a walk-out basement.</p>\n<p><a

Integrating all levels of the property, these zones include formal plantings informed by the neighborhood&#8217;s heritage design guidelines, a designated active leisure with pavilion and sports court, a dining terrace, the trellised walkway connecting the veranda to the new garage, a poolside lounge space, and a walkway between a play structure and the pool house. Natural boulders were worked into boundaries of elements like the infinity-edge pool to soften harsh lines and lean into natural, meandering paths.</p>\n<p><a

Vancouver, British Columbia, Canada is a series of contemporary interventions by Measured Architecture working in tandem with landscape architecture by Paul Sangha Creative landscaping. The truly laudable solutions are thoughtfully composed to consider context while adding only meritorious elements to an architectural patchwork as its quilt continues to unfurl, reflecting this current contribution to a storied historical fabric. “Although my aesthetic is modern,” admits one of the homeowners, “I have a deep appreciation for history and loved knowing that the building, property, and neighborhood had lots to tell already.”\n\nThe Shaughnessy House reflects a curatorial, multi-phase approach to contemporizing the home, which creates a new architectural throughline tethering space and time. A series of forward-looking enhancements are fused with the 4,500-square-foot, traditional foursquare plan – one where rooms are parsed into quadrants, clearly delineated, moving from communal to private programming as the floors ascend – while rectifying updates from an 80s renovation attempt. The structure is now anchored by a grand, four-story blackened-metal central stair showcasing warm wood paneling, an adjacent glass atrium that acts like a light well, and multi-level privacy curtain system designed in collaboration with local artisan Cloth Studio. Guests are granted access to a nearly uninterrupted view through the main volume as its design trades an unmitigated open plan for intentional site lines.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe exterior is also indicative of great discretion having been practiced with structural intervention. While the front facade maintains the integrity of its historical milieu, the rear delights in reinterpreting it. The central volume is expressed by uninterrupted floor-to-ceiling windows that crown with an enclosed glass cupola on the top floor reminiscent of the widow’s walks popular in the home’s aesthetic heyday. This vertical stacking also creates lines of continuation that meet those generated by the infinity pool as the yard reaches the domicile. In playful contrast to the residence – rather than a bastardization of historical elements – is a modern, steel-clad cubic structure situated a short distance from the main dwelling and perpendicular to the infinity pool. The upper portion is clad in mirrored surfaces, which help camouflage the unit while visually enhancing the yard’s depth. Below is a pool house in the style of a walk-out basement.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe Shaughnessy House landscape utilizes indigenous plants in a composition distilled through picturesque visions of lakes and oceans of the Pacific Northwest. “We aimed to create a series of diverse zones that harmoniously coexist under a unified design concept,” says Paul Sangha, principal landscape architect and founder of Paul Sangha Creative. Integrating all levels of the property, these zones include formal plantings informed by the neighborhood’s heritage design guidelines, a designated active leisure with pavilion and sports court, a dining terrace, the trellised walkway connecting the veranda to the new garage, a poolside lounge space, and a walkway between a play structure and the pool house. Natural boulders were worked into boundaries of elements like the infinity-edge pool to soften harsh lines and lean into natural, meandering paths.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNoteworthy still are the myriad green initiatives the Shaughnessy House boasts. The central textile curtain not only provides privacy, but also acoustic dampening and heat abatement. Black solar panels integrated into the top of the poolhouse structure heat the water feature year round. Indigenous plantings embrace rewilding and a stormwater tank system works with the environment to manage runoff. The interior refurbishments include a reinsulated envelope and walls, high-efficiency windows, and the recoating of radiators before reinstalling them in efficient locations connected to a new, state-of-the-art boiler. Among other accolades, this house holds the Architectural Institute of British Columbia (AIBC) Special Jury Award for Heritage Retention and Modernization. “The project started with a 1910 grand house originally built for an English family,” say Clinton Cuddington and Piers Cunnington, principals at Measured Architecture. “And now, introduces contemporary interventions to draw the building into the present.”\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTo view the designers’ respective portfolios visit measured.ca and paulsangha.com.\nPhotography by Ema Peter Photography; Production by Karine Monie.\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t","creator":"Joseph Sgambati III","hasRead":true,"starred":false,"hidden":false,"notify":false},{"_id":177,"source":10,"title":"Clever Ep. 211: The Soulful Renovations of House of Rolison","link":"https://design-milk.com/clever-ep-211-the-soulful-renovations-of-house-of-rolison/?utm_source=rss&utm_medium=rss&utm_campaign=clever-ep-211-the-soulful-renovations-of-house-of-rolison","date":"2024-04-18T14:00:48.000Z","fetchedDate":"2024-04-20T08:53:51.647Z","thumb":"https://design-milk.com/images/2024/04/Clever-House-of-Rolison-Hauser-Photo-Gavin-Cater-810x540.jpg","content":"\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<p><a href=\"https://design-milk.com/clever-ep-211-the-soulful-renovations-of-house-of-rolison/clever-house-of-rolison-hauser-photo-gavin-cater/\" data-wpel-link=\"internal\"><img src=\"https://design-milk.com/images/2024/04/Clever-House-of-Rolison-Hauser-Photo-Gavin-Cater-810x540.jpg\" alt=\"Clever Ep. 211: The Soulful Renovations of House of Rolison\" /></a></p>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<p>Tune in to the latest episode of the <strong><a href=\"https://www.cleverpodcast.com/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener external noreferrer\" data-wpel-link=\"external\">Clever</a></strong> podcast as host Amy Devers sits down with the co-founders of <a href=\"http://www.cleverpodcast.com/blog/ep-house-of-rolison-amanda-leigh-taylor-hahn\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener external noreferrer\" data-wpel-link=\"external\"><strong>House of Rolison</strong></a>, <strong>Amanda Leigh</strong> and <strong>Taylor Hahn</strong>, to talk about how they inject soul into every renovation project they touch.</p>\n<div id=\"attachment_541135\" class=\"wp-caption alignnone\"><a href=\"https://www.cleverpodcast.com/blog/ep-house-of-rolison-amanda-leigh-taylor-hahn\" rel=\"attachment wp-att-541135 external noopener noreferrer\" data-wpel-link=\"external\" target=\"_blank\"><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" class=\"wp-image-541135 size-large\" src=\"https://design-milk.com/images/2024/04/Clever-House-of-Rolison-810x810.png\" alt=\"Two women standing at a modern kitchen island with green chain-link lighting hanging above.\" width=\"810\" height=\"810\" srcset=\"https://design-milk.com/images/2024/04/Clever-House-of-Rolison-810x810.png 810w, https://design-milk.com/images/2024/04/Clever-House-of-Rolison-800x800.png 800w, https://design-milk.com/images/2024/04/Clever-House-of-Rolison-100x100.png 100w, https://design-milk.com/images/2024/04/Clever-House-of-Rolison-768x768.png 768w, https://design-milk.com/images/2024/04/Clever-House-of-Rolison-300x300.png 300w, https://design-milk.com/images/2024/04/Clever-House-of-Rolison.png 1280w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 810px) 100vw, 810px\" /></a><p class=\"wp-caption-text\">Amanda Leigh + Taylor Hahn</p></div>\n<p>Though they grew up on opposite coasts, both Leigh and Hahn identified themselves as angsty teens. Each had a deep love for art and architecture but took different professional paths until they met online, and their fates intertwined. The duo&#8217;s first date turned into a road trip, followed by quarantine-based cohabitation.</p>\n<p>Leigh has been building for clients for nearly a decade, with a background in ground-up construction, while Hahn&#8217;s experience is in software development and architecture. The couple fell in love with preserving and reimagining history in the homes around them, and together they formed House of Rolison. That meant breaking into a male-dominated industry and doing their part to change it. Since the beginning, they’ve renovated a number of forgotten old homes into warm, elegant, modern beauties. Their complementary strengths and deep reverence for their crafts and trades crew ensure each new project has room for magic and a whole lot of soul.</p>\n<p><strong>Listen:</strong></p>\n<p><iframe loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://embed.acast.com/bc5f9100-dfa0-4585-8f60-a2049c614a16/6616ec365b8c180016c7f5cd?theme=light&amp;cover=false\" width=\"100%\" height=\"80px\" frameborder=\"0\"><span data-mce-type=\"bookmark\" style=\"display: inline-block; width: 0px; overflow: hidden; line-height: 0;\" class=\"mce_SELRES_start\">﻿</span></iframe></p>\n<p><em><strong>Listen and <a href=\"https://www.cleverpodcast.com/subscribe\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener external noreferrer\" data-wpel-link=\"external\">subscribe</a> to Clever on any app.</strong></em></p>\n<div id=\"attachment_541120\" class=\"wp-caption alignnone\"><a href=\"https://design-milk.com/clever-ep-211-the-soulful-renovations-of-house-of-rolison/clever-house-of-rolison-beachwood-photo-michael-p-h-clifford/\" rel=\"attachment wp-att-541120\" data-wpel-link=\"internal\"><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" class=\"size-large wp-image-541120\" src=\"https://design-milk.com/images/2024/04/Clever-House-of-Rolison-Beachwood-Photo-Michael-P.H.-Clifford-810x605.jpg\" alt=\"Cozy bedroom with a floral-patterned bed, wooden furniture, and an open door leading to a sunlit patio.\" width=\"810\" height=\"605\" srcset=\"https://design-milk.com/images/2024/04/Clever-House-of-Rolison-Beachwood-Photo-Michael-P.H.-Clifford-810x605.jpg 810w, https://design-milk.com/images/2024/04/Clever-House-of-Rolison-Beachwood-Photo-Michael-P.H.-Clifford-800x598.jpg 800w, https://design-milk.com/images/2024/04/Clever-House-of-Rolison-Beachwood-Photo-Michael-P.H.-Clifford-768x574.jpg 768w, https://design-milk.com/images/2024/04/Clever-House-of-Rolison-Beachwood-Photo-Michael-P.H.-Clifford.jpg 1280w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 810px) 100vw, 810px\" /></a><p class=\"wp-caption-text\">Beachwood \\\\\\ Photo: Michael P.H.

the latest episode of the Clever podcast as host Amy Devers sits down with the co-founders of House of Rolison, Amanda Leigh and Taylor Hahn, to talk about how they inject soul into every renovation project they touch.\nAmanda Leigh + Taylor Hahn\nThough they grew up on opposite coasts, both Leigh and Hahn identified themselves as angsty teens. Each had a deep love for art and architecture but took different professional paths until they met online, and their fates intertwined. The duo’s first date turned into a road trip, followed by quarantine-based cohabitation.\nLeigh has been building for clients for nearly a decade, with a background in ground-up construction, while Hahn’s experience is in software development and architecture. The couple fell in love with preserving and reimagining history in the homes around them, and together they formed House of Rolison. That meant breaking into a male-dominated industry and doing their part to change it. Since the beginning, they’ve renovated a number of forgotten old homes into warm, elegant, modern beauties. Their complementary strengths and deep reverence for their crafts and trades crew ensure each new project has room for magic and a whole lot of soul.\nListen:\n<span data-mce-type=\"bookmark\" style=\"display: inline-block; width: 0px; overflow: hidden; line-height: 0;\" class=\"mce_SELRES_start\">﻿</span>\nListen and subscribe to Clever on any app.\nBeachwood \\\\\\ Photo: Michael P.H.

Epperson says. Material contrast reigns supreme in the most subtle of ways from stem to stern. The moody, dark exterior opens up to a generous common space filled with warm woodgrains, rich marbling, and blue textiles consistent throughout.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://design-milk.com/?attachment_id=541611\" rel=\"attachment wp-att-541611\" data-wpel-link=\"internal\"><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" class=\"alignnone size-large wp-image-541611\" src=\"https://design-milk.com/images/2024/04/NOE-Offices-Studio-Plow-07-door-810x1214.jpg\" alt=\"A modern entryway with a light blue bench, wooden door, black side table with a vase of flowers, and a woven ottoman.\" width=\"810\" height=\"1214\" srcset=\"https://design-milk.com/images/2024/04/NOE-Offices-Studio-Plow-07-door-810x1214.jpg 810w, https://design-milk.com/images/2024/04/NOE-Offices-Studio-Plow-07-door-800x1199.jpg 800w, https://design-milk.com/images/2024/04/NOE-Offices-Studio-Plow-07-door-768x1151.jpg 768w, https://design-milk.com/images/2024/04/NOE-Offices-Studio-Plow-07-door-1025x1536.jpg 1025w, https://design-milk.com/images/2024/04/NOE-Offices-Studio-Plow-07-door.jpg 1280w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 810px) 100vw, 810px\" /></a></p>\n<p><a href=\"https://design-milk.com/?attachment_id=541607\" rel=\"attachment wp-att-541607\" data-wpel-link=\"internal\"><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" class=\"alignnone size-large wp-image-541607\" src=\"https://design-milk.com/images/2024/04/NOE-Offices-Studio-Plow-03-lounge-810x1214.jpg\" alt=\"Bright living room with large window showing autumn trees, blue couch, two small tables, and sheer curtains.\" width=\"810\" height=\"1214\" srcset=\"https://design-milk.com/images/2024/04/NOE-Offices-Studio-Plow-03-lounge-810x1214.jpg 810w, https://design-milk.com/images/2024/04/NOE-Offices-Studio-Plow-03-lounge-800x1199.jpg 800w, https://design-milk.com/images/2024/04/NOE-Offices-Studio-Plow-03-lounge-768x1151.jpg 768w, https://design-milk.com/images/2024/04/NOE-Offices-Studio-Plow-03-lounge-1025x1536.jpg 1025w, https://design-milk.com/images/2024/04/NOE-Offices-Studio-Plow-03-lounge.jpg 1280w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 810px) 100vw, 810px\" /></a></p>\n<p><a href=\"https://design-milk.com/?attachment_id=541608\" rel=\"attachment wp-att-541608\" data-wpel-link=\"internal\"><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" class=\"alignnone size-large wp-image-541608\" src=\"https://design-milk.com/images/2024/04/NOE-Offices-Studio-Plow-04-lounge-810x1214.jpg\" alt=\"Modern living room with a blue sofa, woven circular coffee table, abstract fabric wall art, and large windows draped with sheer curtains.\" width=\"810\" height=\"1214\" srcset=\"https://design-milk.com/images/2024/04/NOE-Offices-Studio-Plow-04-lounge-810x1214.jpg 810w, https://design-milk.com/images/2024/04/NOE-Offices-Studio-Plow-04-lounge-800x1199.jpg 800w, https://design-milk.com/images/2024/04/NOE-Offices-Studio-Plow-04-lounge-768x1151.jpg 768w, https://design-milk.com/images/2024/04/NOE-Offices-Studio-Plow-04-lounge-1025x1536.jpg 1025w, https://design-milk.com/images/2024/04/NOE-Offices-Studio-Plow-04-lounge.jpg 1280w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 810px) 100vw, 810px\" /></a></p>\n<p><a href=\"https://design-milk.com/?attachment_id=541610\" rel=\"attachment wp-att-541610\" data-wpel-link=\"internal\"><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" class=\"alignnone size-large wp-image-541610\" src=\"https://design-milk.com/images/2024/04/NOE-Offices-Studio-Plow-06-810x1214.jpg\" alt=\"A large, textured wall hanging in shades of blue and white displayed in a modern room with wooden floors and glass doors.\" width=\"810\" height=\"1214\" srcset=\"https://design-milk.com/images/2024/04/NOE-Offices-Studio-Plow-06-810x1214.jpg 810w, https://design-milk.com/images/2024/04/NOE-Offices-Studio-Plow-06-800x1199.jpg 800w, https://design-milk.com/images/2024/04/NOE-Offices-Studio-Plow-06-768x1151.jpg 768w, https://design-milk.com/images/2024/04/NOE-Offices-Studio-Plow-06-1025x1536.jpg 1025w, https://design-milk.com/images/2024/04/NOE-Offices-Studio-Plow-06.jpg 1280w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 810px) 100vw, 810px\" /></a></p>\n<p>Awash in sunlight, the interior creates a microclimate echoing the greater outdoors.

The architecture and interior design studio, helmed by Brit Epperson, was tapped by a young couple hoping to breathe new life into the architectural bones of a property that continues to imbue the greater San Francisco, California area with a little bit of heart.\n\nThe 1908 Edwardian structure shares DNA with the adjacent four-square residences and, at a 821-square-foot project size, the petite scale lends itself to a quaintness found in homes built following the city’s 1906 earthquake. Excluding the lower level garage and upper level condominium residence, the renovated space comprises five rentable private office suites, a common kitchen, lounge area, and restroom on the ground level where efforts were focused within the two-story, mixed-use building. The reimagined footprint is configured to create a conducive workspace that bucks commercial aesthetics while accommodating contemporary accessibility requirements, as well as creature comforts to promote a healthy hybrid lifestyle.\n\n\nAnd hidden conveniences like the “cloffice” maximize functionality by making use of areas that might otherwise be an afterthought. \n\n\n\n\nOver the course of six and a half months, Studio Plow’s team practiced care as they stripped the interior down to critical structure before rebuilding with the same consideration for detail typical of its architectural origins. “During this early planning phase, the design team introduced the idea of incorporating curved walls to capture the posts, which not only addressed the program’s complex parameters but also added an iconic detail to the design,” Epperson says. Material contrast reigns supreme in the most subtle of ways from stem to stern. The moody, dark exterior opens up to a generous common space filled with warm woodgrains, rich marbling, and blue textiles consistent throughout.\n\n\n\n\nAwash in sunlight, the interior creates a microclimate echoing the greater outdoors. Perfect for a quick lunch, casual coffee, or happy hour gathering, the common space is comfort-first with soft surfaces including a custom mohair upholstered bench by Studio Plow with Grain Construction, custom tables with leather tops by Klein Agency, and wool fiber art by Megan Shimek. The jewelbox kitchenette is anchored by an exquisite slab of Calacatta Viola marble set in a pavé of custom cabinetry by Reform casework, and further surrounded by Vodder Dining Chairs in Teak, Mid Century Mobler furnishings, Mitzi Leni sconces, an Audo Hashira pendant lamp, and hardware by Buster & Punch. Of particular craft is the handmade Moroccan faucet fashioned from brass, bone, and black resin.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNoteworthy still is a washroom where attention to detail spills over to drench the previously cramped, drab space in as much light and pattern as neighboring areas. Equal parts playful and functional, the updated space is clad in a matte, porcelain wall tile mosaic by Daltile in a custom checkered pattern. Other elements that lean into the camp without going overboard include an IKEA IVAR cabinet, Trueform Concrete lavatory, a the Hail Mirror by Rachel Donath, and bespoke luminaire.\n\nSloughing off years of disrepair, the once dilapidated building stands as a testament to collaboration, a respect for history, and the value of thoughtful design as a mechanism for socialization within any context.\nBrit Epperson, Founder and Chief Creative Officer of Studio Plow\nTo see more of Brit Epperson’s work visit studioplow.com.\nPhotography by Bess Friday; Production by Karine Monie.\nThis post contains affiliate links, so if you make a purchase from an affiliate link, we earn a commission.

For example, each unit comes equipped with a half-roof array of solar panels and a 5 kWh backup battery allowing for net zero operations unplugged from the grid. Cosmic also offers buyers to extend solar panels to cover the majority of the roof for an additional $4,000-$12,000, depending on the home&#8217;s size.

Ironically, such small structures bring with them a large array of things to consider. One company called Cosmic is attempting to streamline the process by inviting customers to spec out solar powered homes equipped with battery storage, high performance insulation construction, air purification systems, and gray water solutions with the same ease as specifying options while buying a car.\n\nThe San Francisco ADU developer offers three Cosmic ONE layouts ranging in price from $279,000 all the way up to $445,500 with all the options included. The smallest unit is a 380-square-foot studio ideal as a backyard ADU, with a 595-square-foot one-bedroom and even larger 750-square-foot two-bedroom unit sized for full-time residency.\nOnce a layout size is chosen, each design can be further customized aesthetically, primarily with the color expressed in the smooth-coated aluminum panel facade exterior, which complements cedar siding or eco-cement fiber.\n\nThings become interesting while configuring the building’s efficiency technologies. For example, each unit comes equipped with a half-roof array of solar panels and a 5 kWh backup battery allowing for net zero operations unplugged from the grid. Cosmic also offers buyers to extend solar panels to cover the majority of the roof for an additional $4,000-$12,000, depending on the home’s size. Similarly, back-up battery capacity can be doubled for an additional $6,000.\n\nRecognizing some prospective small home buyers are seeking a completely off-the-grid existence, there’s also the option to install a renewable water generator system for drinking water. And for suburban backyard plans, Cosmic also offers a gray water system engineered to treat wastewater for safe reuse in “all non-potable needs inside the home, in the garden, or for the pool.”\nCosmic builds each unit with layers of insulation for both efficiency and to create a quiet interior.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nKitchen interiors are offered in two hues of VOC-free natural European oak with handcrafted cabinets featuring a single convection wall oven, integrated LED task lighting, and pocket-in doors to create a clean and contemporary place to cook.\nInside, each unit features a small, but well-outfitted kitchen with an under mount stainless steel sink, a pull-down single-handle faucet and garbage disposal, a four zone induction cooktop, vented exhaust hood with recessed controls, an 18-inch dishwasher, and a nearly invisible 24-inch column refrigerator and freezer with with WiFi connectivity.\n\nAll three floor plans share ceilings measuring 8′ 4″ – 12′ 10″ in height and wide-plank white oak floors. Bathrooms are modern yet warm, finished in Cream de Lyon limestone and white oak, with a water efficient shower/tub and black wall sconces.\nCosmic recently launched the Cosmic 100 ADUs Plan, a response to what the company identifies as an urgent need for affordable housing in a climate changing landscape.

Precast concrete sills and lintels were coloured to match the bricks.\n\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\tRead: Bell Phillips designs brick extension to complement Victorian Gothic school buildings\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\"Regardless of the age of buildings, the surrounding context is uniformly brick with details in stone or stucco,\" explained Phillips.\n\"With this in mind, brick felt like the natural response, with precast concrete standing in as a contemporary replacement for stucco as a secondary material around windows, along the parapet and to the entrance surrounds,\" he continued.\nConcrete cills and lintels match the tones of the bricks\nThe studio designed the building's external walls using precast elements faced with brick, which it said were produced offsite to reduce build time.\n\"From the outset we were conscious that the fluted brick facade would be challenging to construct in traditional hand-laid brick,\" explained Phillips.\n\"The rhythms and proportions of the fluted facade are designed to echo adjacent buildings, [and] these were rationalised into a limited number of repetitive curvatures during the design process to simplify the moulds required,\" he continued.\nThe U-shaped housing was arranged around a communal garden\nDarker mortar was used for the ground floor, which then transitions to a lighter colour for the storeys above.\nInset balconies carved out of the facade were designed to give the block a sculptural quality while adding depth and shadow. The apartments that crown the building have private outdoor terraces that provide views towards central London.\nCosway Street is located in Marylebone in central London\nInside Cosway Street, the apartments have a material palette that reflects the tones and colours of the exterior. Designed by Amos and Amos, the homes have large windows and high ceilings throughout to maximise daylight.\nThe dual and triple-aspect flats have open-plan living spaces that open out onto the inset balconies, with some homes featuring secondary openings onto the outdoor spaces via a bedroom.\nInteriors were designed to reflect the external colours and materials\nCosway Street was designed by Bell Phillips up until planning, and delivered post-planning by Osborne Contractors with David Miller Architects.\nBell Phillips was founded by Phillips and Tim Bell in 2004. Previous projects by the studio include mirrored and larch-clad pavilions added to a science and innovation campus in Oxfordshire, and a timber \"tree-house\" pavilion in Elephant Park in London.\nOther multi-unit residential projects in London featured on Dezeen include a mixed-use project combining housing, artist studios and a gallery in Bermondsey by Coffey Architects, and a courtyard housing block of grey brick in Clapham by Sergison Bates Architects.\nThe photography is by Kilian O'Sullivan.\nThe post Bell Phillips creates Cosway Street housing block with fluted precast

and concrete-lined living spaces to renovate SL House, a detached home in Ghent, Belgium.\nAe-Architecten was tasked with converting the home back into a single-family dwelling after it had been subdivided into two flats in the 1980s.\nThe studio stripped away its later additions and opened up the home's interior with an exposed concrete framework to create a flexible, \"future-oriented\" living space, it said.\nAe-Architecten has renovated a house in Belgium\n\"The construction looked quite solid at first glance, but it was a lot worse than we initially thought, and spatially a lot of quality had probably been lost in the division into apartments,\" Ae-Architecten co-founder Jan Baes told Dezeen.\n\"The new in-situ concrete structure, made using rough-sawn timber formwork, allows for greater flexibility and relationships between spaces,\" he added.\nInstead of a complete overhaul, the studio viewed the renovation as a new \"layer\" to the home, retaining existing elements and complementing them with contemporary additions.\nOld openings are filled with yellow bricks\nThis is particularly evident in the brick exterior, where the existing masonry sits alongside glazed yellow bricks that Ae-Architecten used to infill old openings.\n\"Of all the elements already present in the existing house, the brickwork was perhaps the most valuable to preserve – there were already two types of masonry present and these gave a vertical rhythm and refinement to the house,\" Baes said.\nThere is an outdoor shower\n\"This gave rise to the idea of adding a third type of masonry that could give the house a more contemporary character by interacting with the existing masonry, so we chose a glazed yellow brick,\" Baes added.\n\"We consider the house as a palimpsest in which we preserved the qualities in the existing fabric.\"\nSliding glass doors open the living room to the outside\nSL House is organised across two storeys. The ground floor contains an L-shaped living, dining and kitchen area alongside a study and bathroom.\nA wooden bookshelf, counter, curving bench and window seat help to subdivide this larger space, while a corner formed of glass sliding doors opens onto the garden.\n\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\tRead: Madam Architectuur perches green-tiled home extension on curved concrete terrace\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\"We tried to create a large living space with different zones,\" explained Baes.\n\"On the one hand, we tried to precise and define the spaces with the furniture and, on the other hand, we tried to optimise the links to the different parts of the garden through new cut-outs.\"\nThere is a ground-floor study\nAbove, the first floor contains the bedrooms and a terrace with an outdoor shower, topped by a high parapet that follows the slope of the roof.\nThe primarily neutral palette throughout the home is punctuated by green accents, with a bathroom lined entirely in green plaster and the full-height bedroom cupboards also finished in green.\nThe bathroom is finished with green plaster\nBased in Ghent, Ae-Architecten was founded in 2005 by Baes and Petra Decouttere.\nPrevious renovations in Belgium featured on Dezeen include the refurbishment of a 1960s home Hoeilaart by Mamout and Stéphanie Willocx and Madam Architectuur's addition of a green-tiled home to a home in Dilbeek.\nThe photography is by Tim Van De Velde.\nThe post Ae-Architecten layers old and new in Belgian house renovation appeared first on Dezeen.\n","creator":"Jon Astbury","hasRead":true,"starred":false,"hidden":false,"notify":false},{"_id":182,"source":11,"title":"Foster + Partners first Uruguay project to feature glass-lined courtyard","link":"https://www.dezeen.com/2024/04/08/foster-partners-apartment-glass-courtyard-uruguay/","date":"2024-04-08T16:57:22.000Z","fetchedDate":"2024-04-20T08:53:52.319Z","thumb":"https://static.dezeen.com/uploads/2024/04/the-edge-uruguay-foster-and-partners-_dezeen_2364_sq-1-852x852.jpg","content":"<div style = \"margin-bottom: 15px;\"><img width=\"852\" height=\"852\" src=\"https://static.dezeen.com/uploads/2024/04/the-edge-uruguay-foster-and-partners-_dezeen_2364_sq-1-852x852.jpg\" class=\"attachment-homepage_article_featured size-homepage_article_featured\" alt=\"The Edge by Foster and Partners\" decoding=\"async\" data-pin-nopin=\"true\" srcset=\"https://static.dezeen.com/uploads/2024/04/the-edge-uruguay-foster-and-partners-_dezeen_2364_sq-1-852x852.jpg 1x, https://static.dezeen.com/uploads/2024/04/the-edge-uruguay-foster-and-partners-_dezeen_2364_sq-1-1704x1704.jpg 2x\" /></div><p>UK architecture studio <a href=\"https://www.dezeen.com/tag/foster-partners/\">Foster + Partners</a> and local studio Ponce de León Arquitectos have broken ground on its first project in <a href=\"https://www.dezeen.com/tag/uruguay/\">Uruguay</a>, an <a href=\"https://www.dezeen.com/tag/apartments/\">apartment building</a> wrapped around a multi-storey glass courtyard.<span id=\"more-2055445\"></span></p>\n<p>Located in the upscale Carrasco neighbourhood of <a href=\"https://www.dezeen.com/tag/montevideo/\">Montevideo</a> along the beachside avenue Rambla Tomas Berreta, <a href=\"https://www.theedge.uy/home-v2/\">The Edge</a> will contain eight apartments, with a pool, gym, <a href=\"https://www.dezeen.com/tag/saunas/\">sauna</a> and shared garden located on the lower levels.

Arquitectos have broken ground on its first project in Uruguay, an apartment building wrapped around a multi-storey glass courtyard.\nLocated in the upscale Carrasco neighbourhood of Montevideo along the beachside avenue Rambla Tomas Berreta, The Edge will contain eight apartments, with a pool, gym, sauna and shared garden located on the lower levels. The project is being carried out in collaboration with Ponce de León Arquitectos.\nFoster + Partners has broken ground on its project in Uruguay\nThe building's facade will consist of private terraces that stretch along its 197-foot (60-metre) length. Floor-to-ceiling glass windows and doors enclose each floor and end in curved corners.\nWhite concrete will be used to clad the outside – a nod to the \"pale tones\" of the beaches of Carrasco.\nThe apartment building is located along the coast of Montevideo\nIn the lobby of the four-storey structure, a circular courtyard is lined with clear glass and features a tree.\n\"The cast glass courtyard is at the heart of the design, bringing daylight and greenery directly into the building and creating a unique experience for the residents,\" said Foster + Partners partner Juan Frigerio. \"Its sculptural quality underlines the project's contemporary elegance.\"\nIn the upper levels, the courtyard slices through apartments located at the centre of the building, with other apartments flanking them on either side.

Constructed with steel frames on continuous footings, the structure supports a steel deck and lightweight insulated foundation.\nA single-height pavilion was constructed with steel frames\n\"The white metal structure enhances the lightness of the structure and highlights the rhythmic pattern that is generated on the facade.\"\nSmall sconces are mounted on each embedded column, shining light up and down the white structural members and denoting the supporting grid of on-lookers.\nGuests enter at the centre of the plan\n\"This configuration allows the project to blend into its surroundings, while its single height guarantees universal accessibility and reduces its impact on the landscape,\" the team said.\nGuests enter at the centre of the plan where the landscaped courtyard branches off to the entry reception space and covered waiting area.\nA long porch wraps around the entire plan\nThe exterior walls are set back from the edge of the building, creating a long porch that wraps around the entire plan with a glossy tile walkway and a wood slat soffit.\nOn the western half of the linear building is the gym, wrapped in floor-to-ceiling glazing, that looks out to a covered space for yoga to the west and a grassed sporting field to the north.\nOn the western half of the linear building is the gym\nMoving toward the centre of the plan, private locker rooms are concealed behind an opaque pale green facade made out of composite aluminium planes.\nTo improve the facade's thermal performance, the ventilated facade system has low-emission chamber glass on the transparent sides to reduce the impact of equatorial sunlight.\"\n\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\tRead: Overhanging roof shelters wooden hall in Germany by Steimle Architekten\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\nSimilar but not symmetrical, the eastern side of the pavilion is composed of a restaurant, with the kitchen and service spaces wrapped in aluminium and the dining area looking out to the surroundings through the same glazing system.\n\"Inside, the custom-designed mobile furniture with incorporated vegetation, allows staff to create more private or open spaces for customers depending on the occasion,\" the team said.\n\"The sliding doors that open to the pool generate a direct interior-exterior relationship, connecting the restaurant and the covered lounge area.\"\nIn line with the western edge of the pavilion is a semi-Olympic pool\nIn line with the western edge of the pavilion is a pool with an infinity edge that seamlessly transitions from water to a lush landscape.

This results in our median pay gap increasing to 14.4 per cent across all staff grades.\"\n\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\tRead: Foster + Partners designing two-kilometre-high skyscraper in Saudi Arabia\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\nDespite the apparent lack of progress to close its gender pay gap, Foster + Partners still fares slightly better than many of its peers on pay equality.\nAmong the 19 architecture-focused organisations required to report, including the Royal Institute of British Architects (RIBA) and the Architectural Association (AA), the median hourly gender pay gap for 2023/24 was 14.8 per cent.\nThat marks a small improvement on the previous year when the gap was 15.2 per cent.\nHowever, eight of the 19 organisations reported that their median gender pay gaps had widened year-on-year.\nBesides Foster + Partners, Zaha Hadid Architects, Hawkins\\Brown, Allies and Morrison, PRP Architects, AECOM, Stantec and Ryder Architecture were also in this category. All have been contacted for comment.\nArchitecture pay gap worse than UK average\nAmong architecture studios, Grimshaw Architects reported the smallest gender pay gap at 9.9 per cent, a reduction from 13.3 per cent the previous year.\nBDP, the UK's second-largest architecture studio, has the widest at 20 per cent – with the gap having narrowed from 21 per cent year-on-year.\nThe Royal Institute of British Architects reported a 9.3 per cent gap following a marked narrowing from 15.1 per cent in 2022/23.\nHaving reported a 2.3 per cent gap last year, private architecture school the Architectural Association (AA) currently has no median gender pay gap – meaning the average middle-ranking woman staff member earns the same as the average middle-ranking man.\nCompanies with at least 250 staff in the UK have been legally required to report annually on their gender pay gaps since 2017/18, with 4 April the deadline to publish figures for the preceding financial year.\nAccording to reporting by The Guardian, the gender pay gap across the UK economy is now 9.1 per cent – the lowest level since reporting became compulsory and significantly lower than the average gap at the largest architecture studios.\nMen continue to dominate top-paid roles\nCompanies are also required to provide data on pay distribution and bonuses.\nThe figures for 2023/24 show that while women make up more than half of the lowest-paid roles at 14 of the 19 architecture-sector organisations above the 250-employee reporting threshold, men dominate the highest-paid jobs in all but the AA.\nA higher proportion of men were paid bonuses than women at 14 of the organisations. More women received bonuses at the AA, PRP and Atkins, while at TP Bennett everyone received a bonus and at Allford Hall Monaghan Morris no-one received a bonus.\nLondon studio BB Partnership, which lists 10 employees on its website, reports gender pay gap figures voluntarily. It disclosed a median hourly gender pay gap of minus 13.1 per cent for 2023/24 – meaning that women are paid more than men on average.\n\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\tRead: The 50 most powerful women in architecture and design\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\nGender pay gap figures reported to the UK government are based on a snapshot taken in early April each year.\nThe median is the metric most commonly used to present pay gap data as it provides the best indication of the typical worker's earnings and, unlike the mean which describes an overall average, is not distorted by extremes.\nIt has been illegal to pay men and women different amounts for doing the same jobs in the UK since 1970.\nFigures recently published in Australia showed that the largest architecture studios operating in the country are failing to meet government targets on gender pay disparity.\nResponses from organisations contacted for comment in relation to this story are published below.\n\nFoster + Partners\nA spokesperson said: \"Foster + Partners has recruited more women than men during 2022/2023 as we encourage diversity.

href=\"https://www.dezeen.com\">Dezeen</a>.</p>\n","snippet":"Mexican studio PPAA has completed a concrete villa beside Lake Zurich in Switzerland, fronted by a long water feature that helps to illuminate the interior. \nStepping down a sloping site in Uetikon to the west of Zurich, the home is designed by PPAA to \"blend into the terrain\" with a pale concrete exterior and full-height glazing.\nA wood-lined section of the facade marks the home's entrance\n\"The house is part of an area that is currently being regenerated with many new buildings,\" PPAA founder Pablo Pérez Palacios told Dezeen.\n\"Our proposal was therefore to create a timeless house, using natural materials: wood and concrete, to harmonise as much as possible with its surroundings,\" he added.\nA row of south-facing windows offers views across the lake. Photo by Simone Bossi\nApproaching from the road to the north, the home appears as a single-storey volume. A wood-lined section of the facade demarcates its entrance and conceals a garage door.\nThe home opens to a large L-shaped living, dining and kitchen space with a ceiling that slopes upwards to a row of south-facing windows with panoramic views over the lake and a water feature that resembles an infinity pool.\nThe villa is fronted by a \"water mirror\" that maximises light inside\nDescribed by PPAA as a \"water mirror\", this pool is designed to reflect the landscape and light into the villa.\"The idea was to reflect and emphasise the lake by raising it to the house and framing the views over the landscape,\" explained Palacios.\n\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\tRead: PPAA submerges bedrooms underneath A-frame house near Mexico

converts grocery store into sake brewery in Upstate New York</a> appeared first on <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://www.dezeen.com\">Dezeen</a>.</p>\n","snippet":"Tokyo-based Jun Mitsui & Associates has converted an abandoned grocery store into a sake brewery in Upstate New York in partnership with US studio Pelli Clarke & Partners.\nLocated in Hyde Park of New York's Hudson Valley, the 55,00 square foot (5,110 square metre), complex will host spaces for rice washing, drying, steaming and fermentation for Dassai Blue Brewery, the New York location of the Dassai sake brand.\nJun Mitsui & Associates and Pelli Clarke & Partners have converted a grocery store into a sake brewery\n\"Dassai Brewery is designed to harmonize beauty and functionality,\" said Pelli Clarke & Partners partner Fred Clarke. \"Visitors are invited to observe the brewing process in an environment that blends modern and traditional aesthetics as well as the built and natural world.\"\nThe site contains three buildings – the brewery, housed in the shell of a former Stop & Shop grocery store, a small rice polishing building and a wastewater treatment facility.\nJun Mitsui & Associates and Pelli Clarke & Partners sought to marry elements of Japanese architecture with small-scale manufacturing and its location in upstate New York.\nThe complex is located in upstate New York\n\"Because the site is located in the Hudson River basin and is under extremely strict scenery controls, we paid great attention to maintaining harmony with the historic atmosphere of the surrounding streetscape,\" said Jun Mitsui & Associates.\n\"Partly because the client was a Japanese brewer who mainly makes sake, we also incorporated 'Japanese-ness' into the design.\"\nIt encompasses three buildings\nThe main brewery building is rectangular, with wide-tin-covered eaves wrapped around its entrance that create a covered walkway along its length.\nAccording to the team, it was informed by the Engawa, an element of Japanese architecture that resembles a veranda or porch that runs along the perimeter of a structure.\nThe design marries Japanese architecture with the surrounding Hudson Valley\n\"The main building has a porch space with long eaves that links with canopy-style roof design, which serves to accent the exterior,\" said Jun Mitsui & Associates.\n\"We have created a Japanese-style porch design that not only continues the interior space for tasting drinks, etc. and the landscape as an intermediate area, but also gently welcomes visiting guests.\"\nA covered walkway leads into a tasting room\nFloor-to-ceiling windows line the front of the building, which leads into a tasting room for visitors.\nThe building's brewing facilities are located at its centre and are available to view during tours through several picture windows.\nVisitors can view the brewing process through various windows in the main building\nThe production layout takes advantage of two pre-existing loading docks, moving in a \"counterclockwise flow\".\n\"The brewery seamlessly fits into the building's footprint with production following a counterclockwise flow from two loading docks,\" said Pelli Clarke & Partners.\nA secondary building houses rice polishing facilities\n\"Polished rice moves from the northeast facility building, progressing through production steps, culminating at the southeast corner for bottling and shipping, utilizing the pre-existing loading dock.\"\nThe rice polishing building sits across a parking lot and landscape designed by Reed-Hilderbrand, which incorporates private seating nooks and Cherry trees informed by traditional Japanese gardens.\nProduct is passed from one building to the next through loading docks\nThe building is smaller in stature and is lined with Yakisugi charred cedar cladding with a gabled roof and two overhangs that mirror the eaves of the main brewery building.\nHere, the fatty outer layer of the grains of rice are stripped away using automatic grinding machines, leaving behind a starch interior that will be converted into sugar during the remaining brewery process.\n\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\tRead: Carpenter + Mason fuses Japanese and industrial elements for Brooklyn Kura sake bar\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\nThe remains from the process are taken to the brewery building through a loading dock located on the side of the building.\nOther elements of the brewing process include long, wooden tables housed in a hot room that are used to create Koji, or moulded rice, which is then blended with other ingredients to create a yeast starter for the remaining process.\nIt is part of a wider initiative by the Culinary Institute of America\nThe brewery currently uses Yamada Nishiki

As part of the project, Kuma's studio is also modernising and expanding the building's existing galleries.\nThe original building, which has been closed since August 2020 for renovation, was designed by British architect Leslie Martin to house a mix of contemporary and Portuguese art.\nIt is scheduled to open in September. Photo by Erieta Attali\nKuma's extension is designed to maximise the connection between the original building and the surrounding gardens, which have also been expanded as part of the project.\nTo achieve this, he has created an entrance area with a giant overhanging canopy that aims to soften the boundary between the inside and out. This takes cues from an engawa – a sheltered walkway often found in Japanese homes described by Kuma as \"an in-between space\".\nThe extension is defined by its sweeping roof. Photo by Erieta Attali\n\"In our vision for CAM, we craft a seamless fusion, where architecture and nature converse in harmony,\" said Kuma.\n\"Inspired by the essence of the engawa, we unveil a new outdoor narrative, inviting visitors to slow down and make this space their own. The idea of softness and transition is extended to the CAM interior where we created new spaces by subtraction, replicating the building connection to the garden and exterior light.\"\n\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\tRead: Kengo Kuma adds Japanese-influenced wing to Musée Albert Kahn in Paris\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\nThe 100-metre-long roof has a dramatic sweeping form and creates a sheltered outdoor space from which visitors can enjoy the gardens. On top, it is lined with ceramic white tiles made in Portugal, while the underside is covered in wood.\nLandscape designer Vladimir Djurovic is responsible for the redesign of the expanded gardens, which will be filled with local plants.\nIts design is modelled on an engawa.

region at Casa Ulìa, a villa by local architecture studio Margine.\nNamed Casa Ulìa, or Olive House, after the trees on the site, the 480-square-metre dwelling near Lecce was completed for a couple who wanted an \"oasis of peace\" away from city life.\nCasa Ulìa references the architecture of the Salento region\nTo reduce the home's visual impact on the site, Margine limited it to a single storey above ground containing the living spaces and bedrooms and created a basement for an events space, spa and garage.\nCarefully positioned openings in its pared-back exterior frame the rural landscape, while perforated brick screens filter light down into the home's lower level.\nA raised fireplace is the focal point of the living room\n\"Discreetly, as if hiding behind centuries-old olive trees, Casa Ulìa leverages an underground space to maintain a purely horizontal development on two levels,\" explained Margine.\nCasa Ulìa is divided into two blocks. To the east, a rectilinear volume contains a living, dining and kitchen space and to the west, a square block has three bedrooms and bathrooms.\nThe villa has a wood-lined kitchen\nA fireplace raised on a marble-tiled plinth provides a focal point for the living area, which sits between a wood-lined kitchen and a separate study space.\nAbove the kitchen counter, a horizontal window frames a view of the landscape, while in the living area, a sliding glass door opens onto a patio sheltered beneath a concrete pergola.\nFor the paving of this terrace, Margine used local Leccese stone. Along with the minimalist white exterior, this \"echoes the region's vernacular tradition\" the studio said. \n\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\tRead: \"Water mirror\" reflects light

It is best known for its \"streets in the sky\" typology and for being Europe's largest listed structure.\nIt began falling into a state of decline in the 1980s and its overhaul began in 2004 when Urban Splash won a contract to renovate it. This process has been divided into five phases.\nThe Phase 5 blocks are currently vacant\nThe first phase was designed by studios Hawkins\\Brown and Studio Egret West. It opened in 2013 and was shortlisted for the Stirling Prize in the same year.\nPhase 3 by Whittam Cox Architects, which was next to reach completion, involved transforming five flanks into student housing with a Le Corbusier-informed colour palette.

It was hailed by the master jury as \"the clear winner\".\n\"Park Hill was the clear winner in this category due to its remarkable scale and incredible technical skill,\" said the master jury. \"This project takes an icon of post-war British housing and infuses it with new life.\"\nOther large housing estates that have been revived in recent years include The Bijlmermeer building in Amsterdam, overhauled by NL Architects and XVW Architectuur, and Transformation of 530 Dwellings in Bordeaux by Frédéric Druot Architecture, Lacaton & Vassal Architectes and Christophe Hutin Architecture.\nThe renders are by Mikhail Riches and the photos are by Lizzie Crook. \nThe post Mikhail Riches unveils plans for final phase of Park Hill regeneration appeared first on Dezeen.\n","creator":"Lizzie Crook","hasRead":true,"starred":false,"hidden":false,"notify":false},{"_id":194,"source":11,"title":"\"Those in power want to hold on to their one way of designing\" says Tumpa Husna-Yasmin Fellows","link":"https://www.dezeen.com/2024/04/11/tumpa-husna-yasmin-fellows-fame-collective-interview/","date":"2024-04-11T09:15:46.000Z","fetchedDate":"2024-04-20T08:53:52.309Z","thumb":"https://static.dezeen.com/uploads/2024/04/sq-tumpa-husna-yasmin-fellows-fame-collective_dezeen_2364_col_1-852x852.jpg","content":"<div style = \"margin-bottom: 15px;\"><img width=\"852\" height=\"852\" src=\"https://static.dezeen.com/uploads/2024/04/sq-tumpa-husna-yasmin-fellows-fame-collective_dezeen_2364_col_1-852x852.jpg\" class=\"attachment-homepage_article_featured size-homepage_article_featured\" alt=\"Portrait of Tumpa Husna-Yasmin Fellows of FAME Collective\" decoding=\"async\" data-pin-nopin=\"true\" srcset=\"https://static.dezeen.com/uploads/2024/04/sq-tumpa-husna-yasmin-fellows-fame-collective_dezeen_2364_col_1-852x852.jpg 1x, https://static.dezeen.com/uploads/2024/04/sq-tumpa-husna-yasmin-fellows-fame-collective_dezeen_2364_col_1-1704x1704.jpg 2x\" /></div><p><a href=\"https://www.dezeen.com/tag/racial-diversity/\">People of colour</a> and <a href=\"https://www.dezeen.com/tag/women-architecture-design/\">women</a> working as architects are often actively discouraged from following their design instincts, FAME Collective founder Tumpa Husna-Yasmin Fellows tells Dezeen in this <a href=\"https://www.dezeen.com/interviews/\">interview</a>.<span id=\"more-2056390\"></span></p>\n<p>Fellows, an educator at London's <a href=\"https://www.dezeen.com/tag/central-saint-martins/\">Central Saint Martins</a> university and co-founder of <a href=\"https://ourbuildingdesign.wixsite.com/ourbuildingdesign/architectural\">Our Building Design</a>, argued that some architects in senior positions limit design responsibility to themselves and undervalue the skills of people from diverse backgrounds.</p>\n<p>\"It's very much about ego and who represents the design or the brand,\" Fellows said. \"Women are usually not given that experience or responsibility and even if they are, they're not given the right kind of recognition.\"</p>\n<p>\"It's really good for business to have a diversity of skills and talents, otherwise you just get one kind of design.

That's where architects can have conflicting opinions because those in power want to hold on to their one way of designing.\"\nTop: Tumpa Husna-Yasmin Fellows founded the group FAME Collective. Photo courtesy of Fellows. Above: FAME Collective put together an exhibition on the experiences of minority ethnic women in architecture\nFellows is the founder of architecture community organisation Female Architects of Minority Ethnic (FAME) Collective. The group recently launched an exhibition that aims to present the experiences of minority ethnic women in architecture academia and professional practice.\nHosted in the library of the Royal Institute of British Architects' (RIBA) London headquarters, the exhibition draws upon lived experiences and data collected by FAME Collective as part of a research project titled \"Exposing the barriers in architecture from a FAME perspective\".\nThe RIBA-funded research aimed to highlight the adversities faced by minority ethnic women in architecture and hold institutions accountable.\nFellows explained that there are \"barriers\" people face along the path to becoming an architect in the UK that are common to many, but have a greater impact on women and minorities.\n\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\tRead: Foster + Partners gender pay gap widest on record\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\nAs part of the FAME Collective research, multiple minority-ethnic women came forward to say they are withheld from designing in practice, according to Fellows.\n\"We've heard from women who are really established practitioners in big practices talking about this idea of who gets to design, because it's very much dominated by people at the top and they're usually men,\" she explained. \"The act of designing is a privilege and power that is political in the context of architecture.\"\n\"Even if some women are allowed to design, they're not allowed to have the recognition because the design is taken and presented by a male director.\"\n\"If they design with lots of colours, or design representing their cultural heritage, they are told that that isn't the way architects should be or the language is not acceptable,\" Fellows said.\nShe believes this is detrimental to architecture studios and that they should embrace the wide range of design talents and styles that come from employing people from diverse backgrounds.\n\"We're not celebrating the diversity of the skills within the practice of architecture,\" she said.\nFellows argues that people of colour and women architects are discouraged from designing\nFellows believes this discouragement is also present in architecture education, as multiple minority-ethnic architecture students came forward to say they were advised against incorporating parts of their heritage in their projects.\nShe claimed that students often lack academic support to engage in topics related to their cultural heritage.\n\"One of the barriers that we keep hearing about is architecture education needing to be decolonised, transformed or expanded, and there should be alternatives to the way it's been taught,\" said Fellows.\n\"For example, some of our participants have described that when they tried to do a design project that was responding to their cultural heritage or a discourse they're interested in that reflects their identity, they were discouraged or the tutors and academic staff were not knowledgeable or interested enough to support them with it.\"\nFAME Collective's research found that the number of Black and Asian students falls between each qualification stage, with white men forming the large majority of registered architects.\n\"One of the most striking data we found was that between Part One and Two, and Two and Three, Black and Asian students completely drop out in huge numbers,\" said Fellows.\n\"For Part Three, we looked at the registered architects – 83 per cent are white and 71 per cent are men, so it's very much dominated by white men.\"\nFAME Collective contributed to the Architects Registration Board (ARB)'s plans to introduce an alternate route to the current three-part structure to becoming an architect, aiming to minimise the financial burden on students.\n\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\tRead: \"If we're to ask one man to turn this around, that's a heavy task indeed\"\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\nIt would involve scrapping the current requirement of an ARB-accredited bachelor's degree (Part One) and permitting students with relevant degrees or professional experience to continue on the path to becoming registered architects in the UK.\nFellows believes this more flexible structure, which the ARB plans to fully carry out by September 2027, will help diversify the profession and allow people to earn in practice while completing their training.\n\"The work that we've done with the ARB has informed the recent policy change of how to become an architect,\" said Fellows.\n\"It reduces the financial burden for some students because that is also another huge barrier for people we spoke to – it's not just gender and race, it's also class and your financial situation.\"\nFellows argued that while institutional discrimination towards ethnic minority women is experienced across many professions, architecture has a particularly strong culture of white men being respected as figureheads over people from different backgrounds.\n\"As a society, we've gone a bit backwards,\" she said. \"We still respect and celebrate the white man figure as the architect.\"\n\"It's a societal change as well as an attitude and cultural change that is needed for things to happen.\"\nIn order to enact change in the industry, people in leading positions in architecture firms should attend diversity events and learn from those affected by discrimination, said Fellows.\nFAME Collective contributed to the ARB's plans to reform architecture education\nShe suggested that institutions like the RIBA could do more to ensure equality and diversity in architecture.\n\"RIBA would be an excellent organisation to enforce at least one managerial member of a practice to attend this type of event at least once a year and pledge to come back to tell us what changes you have made to remove the barriers for underrepresented architects,\" said Fellows.\n\"There's lots of ways RIBA could help with this and I guess they are trying to, but I don't think the right people are in the room to engage in the conversations.\"\n\"There should be an exchange and a dialogue between people who are being affected and people who are able to make changes,\" she added.\nWhile she emphasised that FAME Collective's work needs to reach people in power in order to have a significant impact on the architecture profession, Fellows also hopes the group's exhibition is a space where minority ethnic women feel welcomed and represented.\nFAME Collective plans to tour the exhibition and is seeking venues outside of London to reach as many people as possible.\n\"Although we finished our research project formally, our work unfortunately keeps going on,\" said Fellows. \"We have to continue until things change.\"\n\"[The exhibition] is about encouraging a diverse group of women, people like myself, and making a welcoming space where they can see themselves represented in the work and also see some of their barriers being amplified and heard in a platform such as the RIBA.\"\n\"We want to raise awareness of the situation that we are still facing in architecture, of the lack of diversity and absence of women and people of colour.\"\nThe photography is by Sarah Daoudi and Jim Stephenson unless otherwise

A report produced by Plan Arkitekter and Norconsult in 2013 gave the bridge a life expectancy of 100 years.\n\"As far as the Accident Investigation Board is aware, there are no wooden and steel truss bridges in the world that are comparable to Tretten Bridge,\" said the NSIA report (translated from Norwegian).\n\"The bridge was special both in terms of span length and asymmetry, trusses in the same direction and the combination of wood and steel.\"\nAesthetics \"not a governing topic\"\nThe NPRA is currently undertaking steps to improve bridge safety. Four similar bridges to Tretten Bridge will reportedly be rebuilt following inspections carried out after its collapse.\nNine of 14 timber bridges that were closed following the incident remained shut or still had restrictions in place as of last month.\nPlan Arkitetker has designed many of Norway's wooden bridges.\n\"If you read the conclusion from NSIA you will see that the collapse of the Tretten Bridge was caused by deficient regulations (national code) for building timber structures at the time of planning/construction,\" the studio's Yngve Aartun told Dezeen in a statement.\nTretten Bridge stood for just 10 years before it collapsed.

Gothenburg, Sweden, by architecture studio Henning Larsen.\nMade from glued laminated timber (glulam) and cross-laminated timber (CLT), Henning Larsen created the 22,000-square-metre circular structure for Swedish manufacturers Volvo Cars and Volvo Group.\nMass timber columns fan out into the roof structure at World of Volvo\nSet to open to the public on 14 April as part of Volvo's anniversary celebrations, World of Volvo contains flexible spaces to host events, talks, conferences and exhibitions that showcase the history and ethos of the brand.\nSituated in Gothenburg's events district, Henning Larsen aimed to create a centre with a welcoming appearance and access to nature.\nThe building was designed for Volvo Group and Volvo Cars\nInformed by trees and the Swedish landscape, Henning Larsen clustered mass-timber columns into three tubular forms referencing tree trunks, which contain exhibition spaces and stairs leading to an upper level.\nThe columns rise and radiate outwards to form the overhanging roof structure, with the building enclosed by a glazed facade.\n\"The main timber structure forms three striking tree-trunk-like columns, fanning out to carry the entire load of the roof, enveloping visitors in a welcoming forest-like canopy,\" said Henning Larsen.\nIt is located in Gothenburg's events district\n\"World of Volvo is designed around the Swedish concept of Allemansrätten, denoting a fundamental right to nature or 'the freedom to roam', offering an open invitation to the public,\" added the studio's associate design director Martin Stenberg Ringner.\n\"The building uses the timber structure to embody the regional landscape in both form and materiality,\" he told Dezeen.\n\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\tRead: Henning Larsen references ancient construction methods for Faroe Islands university building\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\nA wide staircase rises along the glazed facade and features deep steps for seating.\nAn organically shaped upper level with glazed walls punctures the circular roof. It contains exhibition space, a bar, restaurant, conference space and workspace.\nThe upper level has an organic shape with glazed walls that overlook the circular rooftop\nIntending to create a flow between indoor and outdoor space, visitors can access a landscaped garden on the circular rooftop.\nAccording to Ringner, the glulam structure was sourced from spruce wood from Austria and CLT timber

Ontario</a> appeared first on <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://www.dezeen.com\">Dezeen</a>.</p>\n","snippet":"Toronto studio Workshop Architecture Inc has created a prefabricated home in Ontario with an exposed structure and blue-painted elements on the interior. \nLocated in Tiny, the Unfinished House is a 1,400-square-foot (130 square metre) two-bedroom, two-bathroom home with additional flexible spaces that double as accommodations for visitors.\nWorkshop Architecture has created a home in Ontario using prefabricated panels\nOn the interior, the unfinished appearance is a result of budget constraints and a desire to reduce materials to achieve \"comfort, durability and low energy use\".\n\"The house looks raw and unvarnished,\" said Workshop Architecture Inc. \"The name Unfinished House refers to an aesthetic attitude, an approach to material reduction, and budget restraint that leaves parts of the design incomplete.\"\nMuch of the structure was left exposed to reduce the use of resources\nThe house accommodates two couples, one in an in-law suite with a private entrance, bathroom and kitchenette that can be closed off from the remaining space with a cobalt blue sliding door.\nA screened-in porch and mezzanine were designed to be converted into bedrooms for visiting friends and family.\nThe home has an \"unfinished\" look\nThe main entrance leads into a small mudroom, with the primary bedroom, a bathroom and a laundry room on either side. Two staircases surrounding the space lead down into the main living space and up to the mezzanine.\nThe living space is long and linear, with a light blue kitchen integrated into a far wall and the living space across from it, with the porch at the end.\nIt contains two bedrooms, two bathrooms, a screened-in porch and a mezzanine\nThe sliding door leads into the in-law suite's kitchenette and bathroom, which were clad in white and blue tile with the same blue cabinetry and grout.\nUpstairs, the mezzanine contains a home office and den that can be used as extra sleeping space, while utilities such as the interior heat pump were tucked along the back wall.\nThe main living space is long and linear, with a light blue kitchen on one end\nWebnet wire rope was use as a railing or protective wall, to maximise light and ventilation throughout the space.\nIt is a nautical reference, as the studio was informed by the vernacular architecture of rural Ontario for the house's design, materiality, and colour selection, which includes a mixture of seasonal and permanent beach houses and farms.\nA living space leads onto the porch and into an in-law suite that can be separated using a sliding door\nWorkshop Architecture optimised the house to lower its greenhouse gas use by 90 per cent, according to the studio.\nThe walls were prefabricated off-site and insulation was incorporated outboard, or on the opposite side of the vapour barrier as most homes, which meant the interior wall structure could be left uncovered, eliminating the need for interior cladding.\nThe mezzanine hosts a den that can be used as sleeping area for additional visitors\n\"As the insulation is outboard,\" said the studio. \"The douglas fir plywood and pine wood framing is left exposed on the interior for visual interest and for small storage shelves, inspired by William Turnbull Jr's Hine House at Sea Ranch.\"\nTriple-glazed pine and aluminium-clad windows were set deeply into the walls to create sills that can double as seating, desks, and counters.\nA kitchenette was outfitted with cobalt blue cabinetry\n\"Unlike many contemporary projects, there is a purposeful restraint in glazing,\" said the studio. \"This is a suburban-scaled site, but with the careful window placement, there is a feeling of being alone in a forest.\"\nThe windows were also placed to create cross ventilation, with smaller square windows on the sides of the house facing neighbours to increase privacy.\nIts design was informed by the vernacular architecture of Ontario\nThe studio also limited concrete use by eliminating a basement, choosing instead to lay the house on a shallow foundation and concrete slab, which was then left exposed on the interior to avoid the use of additional flooring.\nThe underside of the roof deck, wood framing, exterior framing and white sheathing were also left exposed.\nThe walls are made of Douglas fir plywood and pine wood framing\n\"Where multiple two-by-six studs form a column an arte povera (poor art) attitude is at play – no upgrading to solid wood, glulams, or wrapping the dimension lumber,\" said the studio.\nThe house runs on a heat pump, LED lights, and an energy recovery ventilator for moisture management and \"very little electricity\", with no gas connection.\n\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\tRead: StudioAC places cedar-clad house on natural ridge in Ontario\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\nSolar power infrastructure for hot water and electricity was incorporated into the house for later build-out, \"when the owner's budget allows\".\nCeiling fans were also installed in the bedrooms, living room and porch to move hot air down in the winter and help mitigate heat and humidity in the summer.\nThe studio is using the prefab wall panels piloted on the house on a multi-family housing project in Toronto\n\"During a major heat wave in 2023, the house stayed under 20 degrees with no air-conditioning,\" said the studio.\nThe studio is using the prefabricated panels piloted during the project on a 16-unit affordable housing project in Toronto.\nWorkshop Architecture Inc is a Toronto-based architecture studio founded in 2010 by David Coluss and Helena Grdadolnik with a focus on sustainable and equitable residential projects.\nOther recent residences built in Ontario include a cedar-clad holiday home tucked into a hill by Studio AC and a Toronto home with a pixilated brick facade by Partisans.\nThe photography is by Scott Norsworthy\n\nProject credits:\nDesign

Photo by King of Hearts on Wikimedia Commons\nWhile it has been known that blue and green infrastructure can cool air temperatures, the group hopes that its findings give a comprehensive picture as to why this is and offer town planners examples of how to mitigate heat in their plans.\nGCARE founding director Prashant Kumar explained that the diversity of planting, dense canopy cover and the addition of water features found in botanical gardens contribute to its effectiveness at cooling the surrounding air.\n\"By incorporating green-blue-grey [human-engineered infrastructure for water resources] infrastructure (GBGI) into urban planning, cities can create more sustainable and resilient environments, mitigating the adverse effects of heatwaves and improving overall liveability for residents,\" he told Dezeen.\n\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\tRead: \"Grassy parks are no longer viable in the face of global heating\"\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\"Botanical gardens feature a diverse array of natural elements, including various vegetation such as tree species, shrubs, and grass, as well as water features like ponds, brooks, and waterfalls,\" Kumar continued.\n\"This combination results in unique cooling mechanisms not typically found in parks and consequently, botanical gardens demonstrate a greater average cooling effect compared to parks.\"\nThe Global Centre for Clean Air Research (GCARE) studied the cooling effect of blue and green infrastructure. Graph by GCARE\nAccording to Kumar, the findings on the effectiveness of botanical gardens can be used to improve the cooling of other green spaces. This could include diversifying plant species, introducing water features, strategically placing plants for shading, and including educational aspects for visitors.\n\"We can draw valuable insights from botanic gardens to enhance the cooling effectiveness of other green spaces,\" he said.\n\"Botanic gardens offer lessons on selecting heat-tolerant plant species, maximising canopy cover for shade, promoting evapotranspiration through diverse vegetation, strategically designing layouts for microclimate control, conducting educational outreach on green infrastructure, and implementing effective maintenance practices.\"\n\"By implementing these principles, other green spaces can mitigate urban heat island effects and create more comfortable outdoor environments for communities,\" Kumar added.\n\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\tRead: Plant trees in cities to curb deadly heatwaves says Arup's Dima Zogheib\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\nFor the research, GCARE studied examples of blue and green infrastructure from across the world and the cooling effects they had compared to the local climate and population density.\nKumar stressed that cooling solutions should be chosen to suit the specific local conditions to achieve the most efficient outcome.\n\"[The research] highlights the need for region-specific strategies in city planning to optimise the cooling benefits of GBGI,\" he said.\n\"For instance, in temperate climates, wetlands and parks are most effective due to their evapotranspiration and shading properties.\"\n\"In continental climates, green walls and botanical gardens show promise, while in dry climates, pocket parks and wetlands play a crucial role in cooling,\" Kumar continued. \"Tropical climates benefit from roof gardens due to their microscale impact in densely built areas.\"\nSharing Kumar's sentiment that diverse green spaces are needed to mitigate heat, Phineas Harper wrote that lawned parks should be replaced with urban forests and Arup specialist Dima Zogheib argued more trees should be planted in cities to curb heatwaves.\nTop photo of Kew Gardens, London, by David Iliff on Wikimedia Commons.\nThe post Study finds botanical gardens offer \"greater cooling effect\" in cities compared to parks appeared first on Dezeen.\n","creator":"Amy Peacock","hasRead":true,"starred":false,"hidden":false,"notify":false},{"_id":202,"source":11,"title":"Dezeen video captures reconstructed spire at Notre-Dame","link":"https://www.dezeen.com/2024/04/12/dezeen-video-notre-dame-reconstruction/","date":"2024-04-12T10:00:46.000Z","fetchedDate":"2024-04-20T08:53:52.302Z","thumb":"https://static.dezeen.com/uploads/2024/04/notre-dame-cathedral-reconstruction-architecture-paris-france-restorations-spire_dezeen_2364_sq-852x852.jpg","content":"<div style = \"margin-bottom: 15px;\"><img width=\"852\" height=\"852\" src=\"https://static.dezeen.com/uploads/2024/04/notre-dame-cathedral-reconstruction-architecture-paris-france-restorations-spire_dezeen_2364_sq-852x852.jpg\" class=\"attachment-homepage_article_featured size-homepage_article_featured\" alt=\"Notre-Dame cathedral under scaffolding\" decoding=\"async\" data-pin-nopin=\"true\" srcset=\"https://static.dezeen.com/uploads/2024/04/notre-dame-cathedral-reconstruction-architecture-paris-france-restorations-spire_dezeen_2364_sq-852x852.jpg 1x, https://static.dezeen.com/uploads/2024/04/notre-dame-cathedral-reconstruction-architecture-paris-france-restorations-spire_dezeen_2364_sq.jpg 2x\" /></div><p>This <a href=\"https://www.dezeen.com/tag/dezeen-videos/\">Dezeen video</a> shows the restoration progress of <a href=\"https://www.dezeen.com/tag/notre-dame/\">Notre-Dame cathedral</a> in <a href=\"https://www.dezeen.com/tag/paris/\">Paris</a>, including its reconstructed spire that is crowned by a golden rooster.<span id=\"more-2057668\"></span></p>\n<p>In the video, viewers can see the 96-metre-tall spire without its scaffolding, with a design replicating the 1859 version designed by architect Eugène Viollet-le-Duc.</p>\n<blockquote class=\"instagram-media\" style=\"background: #FFF;

versions of UK landmarks including Buckingham Palace and Edinburgh Castle for Thomas Heatherwick's Humanise campaign.\nCreated to demonstrate how UK landmarks would look if designed in modernist styles, the agency used artificial intelligence to reimagine the landmarks. Along with Buckingham Palace and Edinburgh Castle, Uncommon Creative Studio created alternative versions of the Tower of London, Royal Liver Building, Palace of Westminster and Hovis hill.\nUncommon Creative Studio created \"boring alter-egos\" of buildings including Buckingham Palace (top) and Edinburgh Castle (above)\n\"The series of images shows six of the most loved and quintessentially British landmarks stripped of their personality to reveal their boring alter-egos,\" said Uncommon Creative Studio, which is a Humanise campaign founding partner.\n\"Using artificial intelligence, fed with 75 years of soulless development data, UnLandmarks reimagines Britain's most beloved buildings through the eyes of its most boring architectural trends.\"\nThe studio also reimagined The Tower of London\nUncommon Creative Studio created the visuals for the Humanise campaign, which was launched last year by UK designer Heatherwick, as it believes that images are the best way of conveying the campaign's message.\n\"We wanted to bring public attention to bear, to create a conversation around the importance of our built environments and the power of design to do more than inspire but to improve our human health,\" Uncommon Creative Studio founder Nils Leonard told Dezeen.\n\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\tRead: Thomas Heatherwick selects 10 \"humanised\" buildings for Dezeen\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\"People are visual though, despite all of the articles, white papers and data on a subject the best way to move people is with something they can see, and then feel,\" he continued.\n\"Taking our most sacred spaces and making them as boring as the rest of our environments is the start of the conversation, the way to bring everyone to the Humanise cause.\"\nThe Palace of Westminster was given a brutalist makeover\nUncommon Creative Studio aimed to select buildings from across the country that would prompt an emotional response.\n\"We wanted to find sacred buildings – immortal and untouchable,\" explained Leonard. \"Then viscerally mutate them with 75 years of bland design.\"\n\"The soul had to leave the building,\" he continued. \"The buildings we chose are the ones that define our country in the minds of every citizen and visitor – making this point with the icons of our nation felt the only way to get people to look again.\"\nThe Royal Liver Building was rendered in the international style\nThe neo-classical Buckingham Palace, the main facade of which was designed by architect John Nash, was transformed into an international-style block, while the Charles Barry-designed, gothic revival Palace of Westminster was given a brutalist makeover.\nThe Tower of London and Edinburgh Castle were given modernist makeovers, while the Royal Liver Building in Liverpool was reimagined with glass and steel facades.\nFinally, the studio transformed the housing on Gold Hill in Dorset, which is best known as the location for Hovis bread adverts.\nGold Hill in Dorset was also reimagined\nThe visualisations were made with a combination of AI graphic tools including Stable Diffusion, ComfyUI, MidJourney and Photoshop Generative Fill, with 200 variations created of each landmark.\n\"Taking cues from 75 years of soulless building data, we created a database of materials such as clapboard, stone cladding, concrete, glass and steel,\" explained Leonard.\n\"The fittings, trends and familiar design tricks,\" he continued. \"These were then paired with architectural styles like contemporary international, volume house building and communist monumentalism – this combination built the foundation for our AI prompts.\"\nUncommon Creative Studio created UnLandmark souvenirs\nTo draw attention to the \"boring\" landmarks, Uncommon Creative Studio created a range of souvenirs featuring the visualisations, which they placed at stalls outside London landmarks.\n\"Initially people reacted with disgust, which is great, and shock, fascination,\" said Leonard. \"A bit of outrage that we'd tampered with iconic, beloved landmarks.\"\n\"Then a worry these were real plans for redevelopment,\" he continued. \"Most people got what we were trying to do.\"\nThe souvenirs included mugs\nOverall, Leonard hopes that the visuals can serve as a \"dystopian warning to the future\".\n\"We hope people realise what we're taking for granted – that beautiful buildings are not just a luxury, but something that's at the core of who we are as a nation,\" he said.\n\"The UnLandmarks project spotlights a century-old global issue: how most new buildings have become increasingly soulless, worsening our health and contributing to the climate crisis.\"\nIt also made posters\nThe visuals form part of the wider Humanise campaign, which was launched last year alongside a book named Humanise written by Heatherwick and a Radio 4 series led by the designer in which he takes aim at boring buildings.\nIn an interview with Dezeen, the director of the team leading the initiative, Matt Bell, explained what it aims to achieve, while Heatherwick selected 10 \"humanised\" buildings to explain its ideals.\nThe post Thomas Heatherwick's Humanise campaign creates \"boring alter-egos\" of UK landmarks appeared first on Dezeen.\n","creator":"Tom

interiors of this cafe and seating area beside a park in Jakarta, Indonesia, completed by local studio Research Artistic Design + architecture.\nCalled Frame Garden, the project is designed to enable the local community to make better use of the neglected park, providing a cafe operated by coffee chain Tanatap, visitor facilities and a small gallery beneath a semi-outdoor tropical garden.\nRAD+ar has used mirrored panels to enclose the tropical Frame Garden in Indonesia\n\"The site is adjacent to an abandoned public park boasting vast greenery with ironically zero facilities,\" said Research Artistic Design + architecture (RAD+ar) principal Antonius Richard Rusli.\n\"Consequently, nobody would pay attention to how much positive impact the park has and can contribute to not only the environment but also to the surrounding communities,\" he told Dezeen.\nTrunk-like sculptures made of fibreglass feature within the space\nThe stage-like Frame Garden incorporates an amphitheatre-style seating area for up to 300 people, which winds between lush planters and trees as it steps down from the entrance towards a large opening overlooking the park.\nDesigned to be \"facadeless\", this open space is framed by alternating mirrored and glazed panels, which reflect the plants and trees and offer glimpses of the surrounding park. Twisting, trunk-like sculptures made of fibreglass also animate the walls.\nThe upper level is lined with amphitheatre-style seating\n\"Frame Garden celebrates its porosity being as open as possible as a contribution to the cityscape,\" explained the studio.\n\"Without a front or back, the building is free to be approached from all directions while taking advantage of the surrounding landscape,\" it added.\n\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\tRead: Angular clay-tile roof crowns Jakarta home by Ismail Solehudin Architecture\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\nBeneath Frame Garden's upper level, the partially subterranean ground floor contains the cafe and gallery, illuminated by skylights that reveal the garden above.\nA stepped ceiling – the inverse of the seating space above – covers the cafe and is fitted with concealed lighting, while a wall of full-height glazing looks onto a covered garden and outdoor seating area.\nThe seating forms a stepped ceiling in the cafe below\n\"Upon entering the building, [visitors] walk underneath a very low ceiling 2.2 metres in height that slowly increases the height of space into 7.5 metres as the visitor walks from the front garden to the back garden on the ground floor,\" said RAD+ar.\n\"[They] are teased by what appears to be sliced skylight and people activities in the garden above.\"\nSkylights on the lower floor reveal the garden area above\nThe gallery sits on the other side of the rear covered garden, which it also looks onto through a wall of full-height glazing.\nFrame Garden's service areas for the kitchen and toilets have been organised along the edges of the site, leading to a parking area at the rear of the building that sits beneath its large opening.\nA large opening overlooks the adjacent park\nOther projects recently completed in Jakarta include a family home topped by an angled, tiled roof and a bamboo extension to a studio.\nThe photography is by Mario Wibowo.\nThe post RAD+ar encloses tropical Frame Garden with mirrored panels in Indonesia appeared first on Dezeen.\n","creator":"Jon Astbury","hasRead":true,"starred":false,"hidden":false,"notify":false},{"_id":205,"source":11,"title":"Detroit skyscraper becomes city's second-tallest building","link":"https://www.dezeen.com/2024/04/12/detroit-second-tallest-building-shop-architects-tops-outs/","date":"2024-04-12T17:00:00.000Z","fetchedDate":"2024-04-20T08:53:52.298Z","thumb":"https://static.dezeen.com/uploads/2024/04/detroit-shop-tower-topping-out_dezeen_2364_sq-852x852.jpg","content":"<div style = \"margin-bottom: 15px;\"><img width=\"852\" height=\"852\" src=\"https://static.dezeen.com/uploads/2024/04/detroit-shop-tower-topping-out_dezeen_2364_sq-852x852.jpg\" class=\"attachment-homepage_article_featured size-homepage_article_featured\" alt=\"SHoP Hudson&#039;s Site tower\" decoding=\"async\" data-pin-nopin=\"true\" srcset=\"https://static.dezeen.com/uploads/2024/04/detroit-shop-tower-topping-out_dezeen_2364_sq-852x852.jpg 1x, https://static.dezeen.com/uploads/2024/04/detroit-shop-tower-topping-out_dezeen_2364_sq-1704x1704.jpg 2x\" /></div><p>A <a href=\"https://www.dezeen.com/architecture/skyscrapers/\">skyscraper</a> designed by New York studio <a href=\"https://www.dezeen.com/tag/shop-architects/\">SHoP Architects</a> at <a href=\"https://www.dezeen.com/tag/detroit/\">Detroit'</a>s Hudson's Detroit development has topped out, making it the second tallest building in the city.<span id=\"more-2057645\"></span></p>\n<p>Named the Tower, the 685-foot-high (207 metre) skyscraper forms part of a larger development in Downtown Detroit called Hudson's Detroit.

architecture studios MIAS and Coll-Leclerc Architects.\n\nLocated on a triangular plot to the south of the city, the building provides 72 apartments across seven storeys and is clad with vertical panels of terracotta-coloured glass-reinforced concrete.\nMIAS has designed a social housing block on a triangular plot in Barcelona\nMIAS and Coll-Leclerc Architects' distinctive use of colour for the development references the area's history in textile manufacturing where fabrics used to be dyed red and dried in the sun, giving the neighbourhood its name Marina del Prat Vermell, or Red Meadow Marina.\nTo maximise the number of units that could be fit on the site, MIAS filled its maintained outline and prow-like edges. Two large cuts divide the housing into three smaller, \"porous\" blocks with planted pathways in between.\nThe block is clad with vertical panels of terracotta-coloured concrete\n\"Porosity refers to the permeability of the building, allowing air to flow through both the structure and the streets intersecting the main volume,\" MIAS founder Josep Miàs told Dezeen.\n\"I am particularly interested in architecture that does not confine, that does not precisely define its physical limits, but instead creates spaces for the gaze to extend beyond the confines of the container,\" he added.\nRed balconies are sheltered by metal shutters\nSplitting the project into smaller blocks avoided the creation of large corridors, instead creating corner apartments with equal access to light, air and views.\nWhile the layout of the apartments in the centre has been kept consistent, the two prow-like corners to the east and the west of the site contain unique spaces tailored to their more angular

This photo and top photo are by Peter Aaron.\nHGX Design created the house to host the owner's visiting family and it now stands as the main dwelling on the 35-acre property, which is dotted with agricultural buildings and another residence.\nThe structure's horizontal form was informed by the vernacular architecture of the surrounding farmland.\nIt was informed by the low-lying agricultural buildings of the area\n\"Comprised of a series of utilitarian, simple form buildings with a repetitive vertical rhythm, the home's elongated footprint is reminiscent of the long, low-lying characteristics of agricultural buildings that dot the surrounding regional landscape,\" said the studio.\nIt consists of four rectangular wings that branch off of an entry foyer. Utility spaces, such as a powder room, laundry room and storage, were placed directly adjacent to the entry, while a long hallway leads to the entrances of three guest bedrooms.\nGlass panels line the majority of the home\nOn the other side of the entry, the largest of the volumes holds an open-plan kitchen, living and dining area, which connects to a primary bedroom and bathroom.\nFloor-to-ceiling windows line the majority of the exterior, with the remainder clad in a vertical cedar siding.\nFour rectangular volumes wing off of a central entry way\nThe 13-foot-high panels were used to capture the rising sun from the east at the front of the house and the setting sun at its back, as well as to create shifts in the material palette throughout the day.\n\"The house meets the sky in a very minimal way, while remaining lightly seated on the ground,\" said HGX Design founder Hal Goldstein.\n\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\tRead: Preen designs Prime steakhouse for a casino in the Arizona desert\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\"It's a predictable system that flows like a piece of music, with subtle tone-on-tone interactions with the elements that bring the colours and material palette to life throughout the day.\"\nThe studio also explained the home defies \"the traditional expectations of an open plan\" with \"no barriers to the visual or physical flow of the home\".\nShadows and daylight were used to create separations\n\"The intimacy of the home's smartly laid out spaces defy the traditional expectations of an open plan, with 11.5-foot ceilings throughout,\" said the studio. \"Separations are defined by sunlight during the day and artificial light at night.\"\nThe house's interior palette consists of neutral tones, with walnut flooring running throughout and dark wood panelling and grey tile used in the bathrooms.\nA neutral palette was used on the interior\nA gym and media room are located in the basement, while a pool, pool house and two outdoor areas sit at the entrance and back of the home.\n\"The land, the views, and the architecture combine in ways that contribute to a very spiritual place,\" concludes Hal Goldstein. \"The overall flow is truly musical, like individual notes of a musical composition, which was the goal of our work from the beginning.\"\nIt was created to host the owner's visiting family\nHGX Design is New York City-based studio founded in 2020 by Hal Goldstein with a focus on corporate, commercial and residential projects that \"inspire human connection and fulfilment\".\nOther projects recently completed in the Hudson Valley include a sake brewery infused with elements of local and Japanese architecture and a hotel consisting of Corten steel-clad cabins.\nThe photography is by Scott Frances unless otherwise noted.\n\nProject credits:\nDesign/Architecture firm: HGXDESIGN\nManaging partner: Hal Goldstein\nCreative director: Hal Goldstein\nLead designers/architects: Hal Goldstein/Stefan Kusurelis\nContractors: CofH Builders Inc.\nConstructors: Pete Mostaccio\nEngineers: DiSalvo Erickson (Structural Engineers), Crawford Associates (Civil Engineers)\nLandscape architects: Wagner Hodgson\nLighting consultant: Claude R.

It is best known for its vast glass-roofed atrium, or nave, crafted from more than 6,000 tonnes of steel, which has served as an ornate backdrop to many international exhibitions and events.\nDuring the Olympic Games, the iconic building will partially open to host fencing and taekwondo events in its nave, before its full reopening as a sporting and cultural events venue in 2025.\nIt is expected that in 2025, the Centre Pompidou will also move into the galleries of the Grand Palais while it undergoes its own renovation.\nChatillon Architectes' ambition for the project is to preserve and celebrate as much of the original structure as possible, honouring the original ambition of its architects Henri Deglane, Albert Louvet, Albert Thomas and Charles Girault.\nThe glass-roofed nave will host fencing and taekwondo events\nAreas of the 72,000-square-metre building that have been closed off to the public have been reopened, with partition walls removed and a public sightseeing route carved into the plan.\nHowever, many elements also required modernisation and updated technology and services to bring it to modern-day standards as an exhibition and events venue.\n\"The scale of the project is quite unbelievable, from the design stage to the construction,\" said Chatillon. \"We have explored thousands of archival documents to truly understand the building and its original intentions,\" he continued.\n\"Our focus has always been to honour and restore the best of the building's past but not to do this blindly, we have approached the project with a contemporary mindset, ensuring that the building is prepared for its next phase of life and that, above all, it is a functioning building for modern society.\"\nIts ornate balconies have been restored\nAmong the main alterations to be made by Chatillon Architectes is the reconnection of its three main spaces, including the nave, which has reinstated the building's original central axis across its H‑shaped plan.\nIn the nave, Chatillon Architectes reinforced and restored the ornate balconies – which it said are among the earliest recorded cantilevers. Updates to this space, including improved escape routes, have also increased its capacity by more than 60 per cent.\n\"The areas of modernisation were embedded in reconnecting the three main sections of the building,\" said Chatllon. \"Over time the building has been divided, with sections falling into disrepair and fake walls erected.\"\n\"When you look at the building through the lens of a coherent visitor experience, allowing each area to flow into the next, then the divide between restoration and modernisation becomes an easy decision process,\" he continued.\n\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\tRead: VenhoevenCS and Ateliers 2/3/4/ reveal timber aquatic centre for Paris 2024 Olympics\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\nA large focus has also been placed on improving the link between the Grand Palais and the surrounding gardens and cityscape, such as the Champs-Élysées.\nLawns surrounding the building are being planted with over 60,000 plants, which are modelled on the curved beds and paths, lawns and plating of the Champs-Élysées gardens. They will be watered with rain collected from the building's roofs.\n\"The Grand Palais was always intended to be far more than a building,\" said Chatillon. \"It was intended to be a cultural quarter that connected with a number of nearby landmarks.\"\nThe landscaped gardens are key to the building's experience,\" he continued.\n\"The new Grand Palais gardens that surround the structure draw inspiration from the nearby Champs-Élysées gardens, sharing a similar spirit with curved beds and paths, lawns, and a diverse selection of planting – 250 species in total, with over 60,000 plants, many from the wild palette of the Paris basin.\"\nChatillon Architectes' goal was to celebrate the original structure\nChatillon Architectes was founded by Chatillon in 1986.

Paris by local practice Jean Benoît Vétillard Architecture.\nNamed Maison Nana, the home is located on a dense urban plot in Bagnolet and provides a series of flexible spaces organised around a central skylit atrium.\nJean Benoît Vétillard Architecture has created a house and artist's studio in Paris\nMaison Nana is accessed by a paved garden, which Jean Benoît Vétillard Architecture has placed across half of the site.\nIt is fronted by a glazed garden room, sheltered by a gently undulating awning and animated by oversized red steps that provide seating and space for plants.\nThe home is organised around a central atrium\n\"Following the volumes of the adjacent dwellings the land is divided into two parts,\" said Jean Benoît Vétillard Architecture.\n\"The built volume is placed in the southern part, where the volumes of the buildings adjacent are higher, [and] the northern part is converted into a full garden,\" it continued.\n\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\tRead: Jean Verville lines Montreal row house with sculptural plywood interiors\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\nFrom the garden room, glass doors lead into the open-plan ground floor. Here, a living, dining and kitchen space is wrapped by exposed blockwork walls and framed by slender steel columns in a pale shade of green.\nOverlooking this space is a skylit, wood-lined atrium that extends vertically through the entire home, punctured by openings in the living areas above and glass brick windows on the exterior wall.\nPlywood walls feature throughout the home\nBedrooms, bathrooms and a studio space are organised in a U-shape around this atrium, with a finish of plywood panelling and deliberately simple fittings to allow them to be easily adapted to different uses by the inhabitants.\n\"The ground floor is left raw, and the more intimate [upper] floors are treated in wood, a more noble material,\" said the studio's founder Jean Benoît Vétillard.\n\"The idea was to remove any form of hierarchy and scale in the rooms on the upper floors, through a complete treatment in wood and a minimum of details,\" he told Dezeen.\nA pale green structure and blockwork walls are left exposed\nThe rear facade of Maison Nana is largely enclosed due to the height of the adjacent buildings but the front elevation overlooks the garden with a symmetrical arrangement of square

Together, we sought to explore the boundaries between the natural and artificial – as in Francesco Mutti's tree-invaded home in Parma, or in the design for a radical decarbonisation scheme in Helsinki called the Hot Heart.\nThe last projects we did together will be presented this year at Milan design week – some organic structures made of rice for ENI at the Botanical Garden and an installation on circularity for Saviola, which reinterprets on a massive scale Louis Poulsen's PH Artichoke Lamp.\nItalo's determination and imagination might have been at odds with his generosity and gentleness. However, they came together harmoniously in that fragile persona who arrived in our office clad in colorful Miyake Homme plissé dresses or original Red Guard uniforms – leaving captivated, fascinated, and filled every person who crossed paths with him with affection. Like architecture, clothing, as a second skin, is also a projection of the mind.\nHe was an innovator, the real kind\nHe was an innovator, the real kind. One of those who can focus not only on new solutions but on new questions (so much more difficult!). He always began with an extremely rational dissection of reality, which he then metabolised in his own unique way with expressions rich in poetry and metaphors.\nWhen his illness surprised him a little over a year ago, we questioned him anxiously after his first doctor's appointment. What was the diagnosis? He quipped: \"I fear that my body is about to lose symmetry\". Together, we joked about this many times: it was about time, over a hundred years after Le Corbusier, to lose symmetry!\nNow, without him, the loss is ours.\nCarlo Ratti is an Italian architect who is the founder of Carlo Ratti Associati and director of the MIT Senseable City Lab. He will be the director of the Venice Architecture Biennale in 2025.\nThe photo is by Andrea Cassi.\nThe post \"Italo Rota's all-encompassing definition of architecture is needed today more than ever\" appeared first on Dezeen.\n","creator":"Carlo Ratti","hasRead":true,"starred":false,"hidden":false,"notify":false},{"_id":215,"source":11,"title":"Foster + Partners tops out China Merchants

Barney Architects has completed a NASA laboratory for deep-space technology testing in Cleveland, USA, which includes a tower made of pre-cast concrete panels for testing antennas.\nRoss Barney Architects created the Aerospace Communications Facility at the NASA Glenn Research Center in Cleveland, Ohio, which originally opened as the Aircraft Engine Research Laboratory in 1942 to test jet propulsion.\nRoss Barney Architects has created a deep-space technology research centre in Ohio\nThe building forms part of a master plan for the NASA site, which has also been designed by Ross Barney Architects.\nThe Aerospace Communications Facility was created for the testing of deep-space technology such as radars and lasers, so the studio started from a consideration of the function when implementing its design.\nIt has a structure made of concrete mixed with copper\nThis included the creation of a special concrete with metallic components for a series of precast walls erected for a radar antenna-testing lab, which stands as a siloed element taller than the rest of the glass-clad building with a separate foundation.\nThe copper in the concrete allows for the building to act like a Faraday cage, completely isolating it from outside radio interference.\nEquations provided by NASA scientist Dr Bob Romanofsky fill the bottom edges of the precast panelling.\nIt has structurally isolated elements\nIn the rectangular, glass-clad volume, a central core was structurally isolated from the building to create stable conditions for the testing of space lasers and other sensitive equipment.\nAIA Gold Medal-winning architect and founder of RBA Carol Ross Barney said that the building is an expression of its function.\nMechanical systems were left exposed on the interiors\n\"This building is totally an expression of what is happening there,\" she told Dezeen. \"There is no aesthetic driver.\"\n\"For a long time I've felt that the best architecture is integrated and functional,\" she continued.\n\"The beauty is the result of the integration of those needs. This building is only about what's in it.\"\nIt has rooms for testing space lasers\nOutside of the more heavily controlled zones, other functional elements were emphasised. On the exterior, undulating metal shutters were extended from the building to control light.\nOn the interior, the studio exposed the metal piping on the ceiling that supplies the various labs, which Ross Barney compared to the aesthetics of spaceships.\nThe outer portion of the glass building has meeting spaces and work areas. The entry pavilion is a double-height space, with part of its walls made up of the etched precast concrete panels.\n\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\tRead: Benzene rings inform patterned facades of Ascentage Pharmaceutical Headquarters\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\nOn the second level is a large pane of fritted glass that looks out over a treeline and a ravine.\nThe polished concrete flooring was painted in some areas to add brightness, and a series of meeting rooms with glass walls were pushed to the outside of the plan, flanking the simple rectangular circulation.\nThe building achieved a LEED Gold rating and was designed to be Net Zero Ready, with hydronic systems such as chilled beams, geothermal heating and radiant heating panels.\nGlass windows in the workspaces open to the foliage\nRoss Barney described the building and the surrounding campus as \"like a machine\" for research and said that hopefully it will work on more building designs as the campus expands.\nOther buildings on the campus include a Research Support Center by TEN Arquitectos with a massive cantilevered walkway extending from its second level.\n\nProject credits:\nArchitect: Ross Barney Architects\nSafety consultant: APTIM\nMechanical, electrical, plumbing, fire protection engineer: dbHMS\nCivil/ Environmental Engineer and Surveyor:

The same cedar is found within the dwelling.\nIt rises two stories and is clad in panels of Western red cedar\n\"Exterior finishes were used on the interior to create a pleasant confusion upon entry and a questioning of where the outside ended and the inside began,\" the studio said.\nEarly in the design process, a guiding concern for the team was preserving a large, native Torrey pine tree that had been planted decades earlier and had grown to dominate the site.\nThe same cedar was used on the interior\n\"Although majestic in many ways, the tree, unfortunately, put the entire site in shade and made for a gloomy interior in the existing home,\" the studio said.\nTo ensure brighter conditions in the new residence, the team inserted a courtyard into the plan, creating a dedicated space for the pine tree. Glazed walls were placed around the courtyard to bring in sunlight.\nThe cedar was used to blur the line between interior and exterior\nThe team located the main living space on the upper level, within the tree's \"sunlit branches\".\n\"This was the first step in a design that sought to meld nature into the home's ethos and combine it with classic California notions of being able to enjoy outdoor living year-round,\" the studio said.\nA courtyard was inserted into the interior of the house and planted with a tree\nIn an unfortunate twist, the pine tree began to lean during the design stage and ultimately had to be removed. The clients opted to plant another tree in its place, and the original design was kept intact.\nThe courtyard now holds a seven-metre-tall tree called a coast live oak, which was craned into place shortly before the house was completed.\nThe living space was placed on the second story to interact with the tree's branches\nThe tree acts as a screen, shielding certain areas of the house from street view and blocking some of the \"powerful afternoon sun\" that comes from the west.\nWithin the home, one finds a fluid layout and a casual atmosphere.\nThe ground level contains sleeping areas and opens up to an outdoor pool\nThe ground level contains a study, two bedrooms, a family room and a garage. The family room opens toward a backyard with a cold plunge pool, swimming pool and casita.\nThe upper level encompasses the public space and a third bedroom.\n\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\tRead: Brett Farrow creates \"chiseled\" houses for Laguna Row development in

forward to the next stage.\nThe Oklahoma City Planning Commission has granted approval of a height increase request for Legends Tower, a proposed supertall skyscraper.\nArchitecture studio AO and developer Matteson Capital announced the proposal earlier this year, which sought to increase the original 1,750 feet (533 metres) tower to 1,907 feet (581 metres), unseating the 1,776-foot-tall (541 metres) SOM-designed One World Trade Center in New York.\nA final vote is planned for the City Council in June, according to Matteson Capital.\nA height increase request for Oklahoma City's Legends Tower is set to move forward\nIf built, the tower will be the tallest in the US and the fifth tallest in the world.\n\"On behalf of AO, we are extremely pleased that the Oklahoma City Planning

It's about starting and working and seeing,\" he continued. \"We're at the beginning and so what you see in these early designs – it's not printed in stone. Rather, it's the beginning of what we're inventing and of something really unique.\"\nGlass encloses the base of the building, while the third story is opaque and sits on top\nThe building's programming will take place across three storeys, with one section of the building dedicated to a large multi-purpose event and performance space that will \"merge seamlessly\" with an outdoor piazza.\nThe remaining space will contain a public lobby, working spaces, a maker space, creator residences, a startup incubator, food services and social areas.\nA central plaza will host outdoor events\nRenderings show a wedge-shaped building wrapped in a glass facade with a large plaza at its centre, protected by sunshades that span its width.\nA third floor, clad in an opaque material, sits on top. In some areas, it is affixed to the glass base while in others it is hovering just above it, supported by thin pillars.\nRenderings show a double-height lobby with a textured ceiling\nThis third-floor space will host food and beverage services, along with 100,000 square feet (9,290 square metres) of solar panels to provide electricity and hot water.\nA red, rectangular viewing box will be suspended above the third-floor roof, accessed by a staircase, and will be used  as an additional space for events.\n\"Above the roof, there will be a special 100-person capacity panoramic space, known as the Belvedere, dedicated to both public and special events with 360-degree views of the city, ocean, and beyond,\" said the team.\nA viewing box suspended above the the third floor will host additional event space\nInterior renders show a textured ceiling, with floor-to-ceiling glass enclosing a double-height lobby that is outfitted with brightly-coloured furniture and an exposed, skeletal staircase.\nBased on the \"four societal pillars\" of arts, education, business and community, the project aims \"to pioneer a new approach to how the world designs, imagines, programs, utilizes and embraces its cultural infrastructure\" according to the team.\n\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\tRead: Renzo Piano stacks Toronto courthouse on top of massive atrium\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\"Innovation is like beauty – you don't just say someone is beautiful for their exterior, they're also beautiful because of their mind,\" said Piano.\n\"The same sentiment will apply to the center.
